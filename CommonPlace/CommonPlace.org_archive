 At this point in time Pre-Pay SMS sometimes adds unprintable
 characters to the *APE1\_RATED\_EVENT* table. The following SQL needs
 to be run before the *Billing jobs* can be started to clean up these
 un-printable characters.

 1. First create a temporary table with all of the rated events that
 has a corrupt calling number. *Remember to change the cycle and
 instance to the ones you're working on. In the below 

 :  create table *ape1_rated_event_corrupt_cyc2* nologging as
 :  select a.l9_calling_number,substr(l9_calling_number,0,10) FIXED_CALLING_NUMBER,
 :         a.event_type_id,l9_called_number,source_id,l9_is_online,l9_dialed_digits,
 :         cycle_code,cycle_instance,cycle_year,customer_id,subscriber_id,resource_value,
 :         customer_segment,event_id,start_time from ape1_rated_event a where 1=1 
 :  and REGEXP_LIKE(l9_calling_number, '[^ -~]') 
 :  and l9_calling_number<>' ' 
 :  and event_type_id=54 
 :   and *cycle_code=2* and *cycle_instance=9*
 :  and l3_payment_category <> 'PRE';
    - There could be a possibility that the table we are creating
      already exists, if that is the case *drop table {table name}*
      before running the query.
 2. If you wish to see the result table run the following:
 :  select * from ape1_rated_event_corrupt_cyc2;

 3. Next update the rated event table with the contents of the
    temporary table again remembering to change to the correct temp table.
 : update ape1_rated_event 
 :        set l9_calling_number = substr(l9_calling_number,0,10) 
 : where  (CUSTOMER_ID,SUBSCRIBER_ID,START_TIME,EVENT_ID,CYCLE_CODE,CYCLE_INSTANCE,CUSTOMER_SEGMENT)  in 
 :        (select CUSTOMER_ID,SUBSCRIBER_ID,START_TIME,EVENT_ID,CYCLE_CODE,CYCLE_INSTANCE,CUSTOMER_SEGMENT 
 :        from *ape1_rated_event_corrupt_cyc2*);

It is
Sorry David... Do you want us to rerun th is job when it is up?


12:55 AMBalchen, DavidThis is exciting everything is going to hell!!!
That the usual procedure.. For this type of error
RERUN


12:56 AMMazza, ZacSounds good. I'll note the ticket.


12:56 AMBalchen, DavidOk now to our other problem


12:57 AMMazza, ZacJust sent an e-mail to AMDOCS to see who is on from the TC group
Looks like it's navin tellis, but he's inactive at the moment.


12:58 AMBalchen, DavidIt's Nicola Poppa and he's not answering his phone


12:59 AMMazza, ZacLet me send over another e-mail... we are looking to find out:

Why the three jobs failed and how to continue, and how/if we need to clear out the current maps so that we can resubmit a new EXTRACTS for cycle 8, is that right?


12:59 AMBalchen, DavidYep
Kyle this what I see from your query...
Bear with me I'm going to try something here

YIKES thats ugly
My question is the status = Y what exactly does that mean
Does it mean it's running????


1:05 AMStephan, Kyleit means the map has locked those instances


1:05 AMMazza, ZacSent e-mail... copied you both for awareness.


1:05 AMBalchen, DavidSo can we set them to N???
Is that what you mean by clearing the locks?
or delete the rows
I just got a message from Anil so he's awake


1:07 AMMazza, ZacYeah. Just asked on the bridge... he said he needed 20 minutes
Hi

 

Will check and update

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Navin Tellis



1:10 AMMazza, ZacNavin just came available in chat
I'll see if I can invite him


1:10 AMBalchen, DavidCool..


1:10 AMMazza, ZacInviting now...


1:11 AMBalchen, DavidHello Navin Happy Sunday!!! 


1:11 AMMazza, ZacHello Navin


1:11 AMTellis, NavinHi 


1:12 AMBalchen, DavidNavin.. We have several billing maps fail because the downstream jobs are not getting there parameter files.
Seems like a simple problem to fix but we are unclear on the procedure how to fix
I called my Tier 3 guy but he is not answering his phone


1:14 AMTellis, Navinill check
will update in some time


1:18 AMMazza, ZacYaroslav Kek said he could cancel the maps for us when we were ready...


1:19 AMBalchen, DavidBut is that the right thing to do??? Kyle what do you think.


1:20 AMStephan, Kylewe had a similar situation on Tuesday
worked with Amit to cancel one of the duplicate maps


1:20 AMMazza, ZacHey Navin. The EXTRACTS map is cycle 11897. This is the map we experienced the multiple failures in.


1:20 AMStephan, Kylehe cleaned up something in TC
and then we continued with the other map


1:21 AMBalchen, DavidWell he has yet to share that infoemation with us..
Must be that tier 3 hocus pocus
and how do we get duplicate maps???


1:24 AMStephan, Kylenot sure how the second one got created
either MRO duplicated it or someone in billing didn't understand why it wasn't running
and incorrectly started a second one


1:26 AMBalchen, Davidinteresting


1:28 AMTellis, Navinplease rerun the failed jobs ADJ1RCAEXT and ADJ1OCEEXT


1:29 AMStephan, Kylefrom which map?


1:29 AMTellis, Navini see that ADJ1RCPEXT_X862013_USC_20130921_235403.log is successfull


1:30 AMMazza, ZacIt abended in the map...
Though job log showed successful


1:30 AMTellis, Navinok
ill check the map 


1:35 AMMazza, ZacYaroslav said he is on standby if we need assistance clearing old maps.
Waiting on confirmation Navin on which jobs we need to run from which map... please be aware we have two cycle 8 maps... one from ~ 20:00 CT and one from ~23:00 CT


1:36 AMTellis, Navini think 
BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC 
 
 

is the map
the other map thought activated but none of the jobs have run
though*


1:40 AMTellis, Navinsorry my map wasnt loaded properly... sorry for the confusion
but i think the map i mentioned above would be the appropriate one


1:42 AMMazza, ZacHey Navin.
I've got the following maps with failures?
For cycle 8


1:43 AMStephan, Kyleso do we want to just rerun them from the second, later map?


1:43 AMTellis, Navinok


1:43 AMMazza, ZacBLPREP_Rerun_2720309_amc_20130921.201716_x_205.USC


1:43 AMTellis, Navinthere is one more map
BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC


1:43 AMMazza, Zacand BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC


1:44 AMTellis, Navinyes i think going ahead with this one would be better option


1:44 AMMazza, ZacSo we need to rerun the jobs from the 206 map? 
and BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC?


1:44 AMTellis, Navinyes


1:44 AMMazza, Zacplease rerun the failed jobs ADJ1RCAEXT and ADJ1OCEEXT
Rerunning now from second map
Do we need to do anything with the 205 map?


1:45 AMTellis, Navinthere is one job failed on map 206
rerun that too


1:45 AMMazza, ZacAre you referring to the QA mpa?


1:46 AMTellis, Navinno its with job req X862013


1:47 AMMazza, Zacok
just to confirm


1:47 AMTellis, NavinADJ1PEFNSHN


1:47 AMMazza, Zacfrom map BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC

** What are you most proud of?
   The wide variaty of and the many new things I've done this year. My slogan for this year has been "Doing things that I have no idea how to do", in which I thought I did a more then adiquete job.
** What challenged you the most?
   The only thing that wasn't as much of a challenge was the changes I made to the CallDump, since I'm very familier with the application.
   Things like the development projects the process was changed and my role changes taking a more advisorly role instaed of a development role.
   Outcollects in particular since all testing and changes needed to be made in production, not to mention we needed to deal with release schedules Moratoriums and outside venders and licensing issues.
** What are your key learnings?
   Don't be afraid to ask questions and also it's is good to make descisions,  because even if it's wrong you will learn from it and eventually come to a solution.
** Associate Strengths
   A good team player with a good working attitude.
** Associate Development Opportunities
   To listen better and not to be intellectually lazy.
** CREATING CUSTOMER VALUE
   /Crafting and implementing world class practices that generate customer value and result in customer advocacy; ensuring that the customer experience is a driving force behind business decisions, activities, and customer offerings./
   I've created customer value by either leading or participating with the following projects.
   1. BPT /Business Process Tables/ \\ I'm in charge with over 28 tables that handle various aspects of the mediation and rating process that need to updated on a regular basis.
   2. CallDump I'm the designer, developer and maintainer of the *CallDump* system that's required by law for us to have. This requires me to handle field inquiies about the results, machine maintainence and code updates and other enhancements.
   3. UFF /The Unified File Format/\\ I'm the SME for our production CDR /Call Detail Record/ format because of this I required to be involved with any new data feeds. This year because of my expertice I was hevily invloved in various projects such as *GSMi* and *Volte*
   4. Outcollects. \\ I was the lead developer, tester for the Outcollect process that was finally moved over to TOPS after 18 months since implimentation.
   5. Development Projects \\I was invloved with the following development projects either as a Reviewr, developer, Approvar or all of the above for the following projects.
      1. Volte - /Approver, Reviewer, Developer/
      2. GSMi  - /Approver, Reviewer, Developer/
      3. Data OutCollects - /Approver, Reviewer, Developer/
      4. BMD Business Verticals - /Approver, Reviewer/
      5. PrePaid Canvas - /Approvar, Reviewer/
      6. Activation Portal - /Approver, Reviewer/
      7. Activation Before Notify Billing - /Approver, Reviewer/
      8. Directory Assistance Handling for CIBER In-collect -  /Approver, Reviewer, Developer/
      9. Incomming Messages - /Reviewer/
      10. Inbound Toll Charge Changes /Reviewer/
** MAKING QUALITY DECISIONS
   I make and take responsabilty for all mydeciesions.   
** COMMUNICATING WITH IMPACT
   /Clearly and succinctly conveying information and ideas to individuals and teams in a variety of situations; communicating with openness and enthusiasm to educate, influence, or move others to action./
   This year has been a big year for communicating concepts and ideas be it knowledge transfer via the WIKI, Change control meetings, development projects or just explaining complicated technical subjects to the business.
** PURSUING AND DEMONSTRATING TECHNICAL/PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE
   This year I was the lead for the Outcollect project where we finally move the Outcollect process to TOPS. In addition we started handleng CIBER 32 (Data) records as well. This not only required learning the data formats but coordinating all aspects of the project.
** APPLYING INNOVATION AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
   I'm always on top of the latest trends in technology and looking for ways to use them to improve our processes.
** COLLABORATING ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES
   /Working across multiple functional disciplines to solve complex business problems and to achieve business goals./
** DELIVERING RESULTS
   In my 14 years being at US Cellular every project I've been associated with my portion has never been delayed, failed or over budget.
** EMBRACING AND NAVIGATING CHANGE
   Nothing makes me happier then to be in situations where I'm needed to find a solution to a problem and that problem is something I've never done before.
** OPERATING WITH A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
   My overall philoaphy in life as well as business has been to understand 
** DEVELOPING TALENT
   I believe I'm a good team member that creates a friendly working environment that helps promote learning and understanding.

  *CIBER* files are a collection of roaming records, these can be
  either a foreign carrier on our network or one of our customers
  on another network. More succinctly there are two
  types of roaming scenarios.
    1. *OutCollects*\\ Non-USCC customers using our network, eventually
       the records created become part of the *Out-Collect* process.
    2. *InCollects*\\ USCC customers roaming on another carriers
       network. These records are sent to Syniverse which in turn
       sends them to us and become part of our *In-Collect* process.

     1. Switch records are passed through the billing system and any
        record that does not belong to a customer gets placed into a file. 
     2. Twice a day the /Ciber\_Create/ job is run which takes these
        files and converts them to CIBER records.
     3. Five times a day *NDC* starts a job which sends these files to
        *Syniverse*.
     4. It also when it looks for CIBER files coming back from
        *Syniverse* of our customers who are roaming on other networks.
   - *Thoughts and other random musings* \\ A pretty simple batch
     interface it is here where we can use the new batch standards to
     make sure the transfer is complete.

  Presently we have a PowerBuilder extract tool which sends this
  information to a *COBOL* program that calculates the entries which is then added to *SAP*.
  - The two primary actions are:
    1. *Daily Journaling*
    2. *ATB - Aged Trial Balance*
  - *Amdocs* has the *G/L Configurator* extracts that can to extract the data needed to be loaded to *SAP*.
    - These extracts also can be downloaded as *EXCEL* Spreadsheets.
  - *Summary Level Accounting* must be done with data from the
    *B/OSS* or a Real-Time *ODS.*
   - *Payments*
     - *CyberSource* is the new *Protobase*
     - All payments happen within the *Accounts Receivable Manager*. 
     - Need to define a new business process for *PrePay*.

   Has many of the CRM UI's to outside collection agencies and banks
   already configured *OOTB[fn:OOTB: Out of the Box]* , and if not, you can use the *Extract UI tool* to create one. By using *APM[fn:APM: Amdocs Process Manager]* we can control format of the collection file.

    - *Collections*
      - At present data is brought back from the *RCV/BCV* where
        trending analysis then takes place. Where they target at risk customers.
      - At present they have 100 collection paths and 25 collection activities.
        - The decisioning engine is done in SAS and the results in the
          *NFSC* database or in the case of the *Dashboard* a *MySql*
          database.
      - The big question is how real-time is this data, because this process needs as close to real-time as you can get.
      - Rebbecca would like two interfaces added for future state.
        - The first is a Real-Time Interface that would talk to a 3rd party, it will be called /Collection Augmentation/.
        - Payment arrangements via the IVR in Real-Time.
        - A widget on the screen that indicates an at risk customer.

   - High Dollar Amount Recovery Procedure
     *IMPORTANT : High Dollar amounts must be reversed on the same day they are created.*

     1. Amdocs OCCGMSCPSGUSCCBOPSAR@amdocs.com receives an
        internal alert indicating there is a high dollar amount
        issue.
     2. Amdocs OCCGMSCPSGUSCCBOPSAR@amdocs.com calls the USC
        Billing On-Call Person from the daily Billing Priorities
        Email as soon as the alert is received.
     3. Amdocs OCCGMSCPSGUSCCBOPSAR@amdocs.com sends an email to
        the USCDLISOps-BillingandAROperations@uscellular.com
        email distribution list within 1 hour of the initial
         internal alert. This email contains:
         -  FA/BAR
         -  transaction_id
         -  amount (e.g. charges_amount)
         -  tax_amount
         -  debit_id
         -  l9_geo_cod
         -  operator_id (associate id)
         -  first_name
         -  last_name
         -  e_mail
         -  employee_no
         -  work_group

     4. USC forwards the Amdocs communication email to the
        following Financial Services email addresses within 1
        hour of receiving the email communication from Amdocs:
        -  NFSC-TulsaResolutions@uscellular.com
        -  NFSCMADFSHelpDesk@uscellular.com
        -  Lane.Dohl@uscellular.com

     5. Financial Services reverses any incorrect transactions
        and replies to the email distribution list for USC and
        Amdocs. If the process is successful, no further action
        is required. If there are any other issues, further
        escalation is needed using our standard processes. This
        escalation requires a Sev-3 ticket created and routed to
        the Amdocs Tier 2 Billing queue.

      *CIBER* files are a collection of roaming records, these can be
      either a foreign carrier on our network or one of our customers on
      another network. More succinctly there are two types of roaming
      scenarios.

      - *OutCollects*\\
      Non-USCC customers using our network, eventually the records
      created become part of the *OutCollect* process.

      - *InCollects*\\
         USCC customers roaming on another carriers network. These
         records are sent to Syniverse which in turn sends them to us
         and become part of our *InCollect* process. All though
         InCollects come pre-rated they are still re-rated according to
         their plan.
\\

               needs to be done to the other 7 tables. For example if it
               is a brand new *SID* all 8 tables need to be updated with
               the most complicated part setting up InCollect and
               OutCollect processing for a *SIDS* contract. The
               following explains in details on what needs to be done:

               1. Find the entry in the *PC9_INCOL_SID_PAIR* where
                  the *SERVE SID* is the contract number and the *HOME
                  SID* = '175' /(USCC contract number)/.

                  1. Expire the date for when you want the new rate to
                     take affect.
                  2. Use the above row as a template for an insert
                     statement.
                  3. *For outcollecs do the same as above except use
                     SERVE SID = '175'*

               2. Create an Insert statement for the
                  *PC9_INCOL_SID_PAIR* with the new rates.
               3. For the OutCollect side find all *SIDS* that that have
                  the *Settlement Contract Code*, /(In this example we
                  trying to find all *SIDS* with settlement contract
                  code = 287)/

              
                  : SELECT SIDS FROM PC9_SID WHERE SETLMNT_CONTRACT_CD = '287';
           

               4. For each *SID* found add '175' to the end and use that
                  as the resource value for the table
                  *AGD1_RESOURCES_REF* then create an insert if it
                  don't exists.

               5. For each *SID* found add a '1' in front which will get
                  you the *customer_id* then do a query against the
                  *APE1_SUBSCR_DATA_REF* to get the subscriber_id

               6. Once you have the subscriber you need to point each
                  entries offer ID's from the
                  *APE1_SUBSCR_OFFERS_REF* table to the correct air
                  and toll charge. /(Again using the above example)/ To
                  find a suitable offer ID search the *CSM_OFFER*
                  table, if you cannot find one have the *EPC* group
                  create one. (/In this example we are looking for a
                  offer ID with the Air and Toll charge of 0.3/)

** Security - Cybersecurity
   We are all responsible for security while implementing new and changing existing apps.
   - Invest consistent with our assessment of the threat landscape
   - Assuring our network, applications and data are secured at all times.
   - Individual and personal responsibility â physical security, desktop locking, to emails sent
   - Logfiles, sensitive information, cpni audits, access and role reviews
   Within the Collaborate tool ensure that there is acknowledgement from the person that is 
   reviewing the code or data change, that all security risks have been addressed.

   To use Collaborate we must learn Collaborate. Luckily there are many free videos on how to do 
   just that.

   When writing software keep in mind any possible bugs that can be exploited such as, SQL injection,
   man in the middle, etc.

   Have your code reviewed by the team and follow the Open Source mantra,
   "Many eyes make all bugs shallow".
** DevSecOps
   - Growing as a team to build the agile framework for our teams.
   - Moving our teams to be agile.
   - Using the agile tools where applicable.

   Ensure that everyone leader has at least one DevOps or Agile goal within their IDPs.
   Ensure that our teams have the needed Agile training and knowledge to support our 
   organization moving toward a more Agile framework.

   Need to learn and master the following Agile tools:
   - Git
   - Jira
   - Collaborate

** Stability

   Maintain high availability of customer and front-line facing systems:
   Continue to deliver accurate and on-time bills
   The total Billing Timeliness and Accuracy metric will be the weighted average of the 
   two components, with timeliness being capped at the midpoint percentage for EE and FE ratings.

   - Timeliness
    - FE = 99.99-100% Delivered on Time
    - EE = 99.97-99.99% Delivered on Time
    - ME = 99.95 - 99.97% Delivered on Time
    - PM = <99.95 % Delivered on Time
   - Accuracy
    - FE = 99.97-100% Accurate Invoices
    - EE = 99.91-99.97% Accurate Invoices
    - ME = 99.69-99.91% Accurate Invoices
    - PM = <99.69% Accurate Invoices

   1. Ensure critical billing issues are handled via Incident bridge to ensure Billing 
   timeliness and Accuracy
   2. Participate in daily Billing calls, monthly meetings with Amdocs and IMC.
   3. Ensure all defects are fully resolved and deployed successfully in production.

   Drive stability through faster issue/incident resolution through Service Ownership (EAGR):
   - Create Playbooks and Operational Support Guides for all team owned services including:
    - Credit Decisioning
    - Fraud Management
    - Billing
    - Payment Processing
    - Usage Processing
    - EOD/EOM and Journaling
    - Credits Processing
    - MCO Processes for Financial Services
    - On-Call
    - Collections Processing

   Rigorous Change Management:
   Reduce the number of changes that are brought to CAB for approval.  
   In 2018 there was 88 changes brought to CAB for approval.  In 2019, this number should 
   be reduced by 10% to 79 changes.

   Help and assist in defect management as well as building monitors to gain insight into a 
   process and to provide better and more useful information. Make sure all code in GITHUB is up to date with the latest changes.
   

** Speed to Market
   Rapid enablement of new products and services using the âfastest time to valueâ approach.

   Continued focus on delivering faster with a concentration on improving quality.

   Implement a DevOps "Shifting Left" Concept - For the development work that the 
   IS Billing and Revenue Dev Ops team are doing (for monitors, controls, altering, 
   reporting, and automation) we should start with building test cases first, then 
   build functionality are that. 

   Rollout the use of the Collaborator tool and the supporting processes.  This tool will be used 
   to automate and facilitate some of the Quality Assurance processes for new or updated code 
   and data changes.

   Ensure that the IS Billing and Revenue Dev Ops team provides all requested audit documentation 
   or surveys to the auditors within the stated deadlines for the following SOX controls:  
   Compliance met for all 4 quarters testing of following controls :
   - CP1001 - Application of Credits vs. Charges
   - CP1003 - Pre-paid Customer Processing Configuration/ Mapping
   - CP2002 - AR Payment Processing Validations
   - CP2003 - Duplicate Payment - Batch Processing
   - CP2004 - Write off of Uncollectable AR
   - CP2007 - AR Payment Processing Error Flagging
   - CP2018 - Duplicate Payment Processing - Real-time Payments

   I will learn and implement Collaborator and Jira and use the Agile processes. Since I've been using agile for quite a while, back when there were known as iterative processes, It should
   be no problem for me to adjust. The only issue I see is that we may take the process to seriously and can handcuff development.

** Savings
   Know the budget for projects.
   Resource investment that adds value.
   Responsible for managing project delivery and operating expenses based on forecasted budgets.
   Responsible for ensuring projects and IRs do not negatively impact operations and increase costs.

   Ensure that operational cost are evaluated for each project that impacts the billing and revenue domains.

   Participate in projects to ensure Operational Excellence including:

   - Trans Union Credit Decisioning (EAGR) 
   - Fraud for Web Evolution (EAGR)
   - VISA and Discover Mandate 
   - Prepaid Evolution 
   - Web Evolution 
   - Replace Nokia/Aeris M2M/CDP 
   - Voice over WiFi 
   - Fixed Wireless 
   - IR430.3 - New First Page of the Bill
   - Paper to Paperless Initiative 
   - Remedy Upgrade 
   - IR0583 â Stand-Alone ESIM Provisioning 
   - PCRF Forklift Project  
   - IR0600 â 5G Commercialization 
   - IR0596 â International Services Revamp 
   - IR0597 â Proxy Identity Access Management 
   - IR0549/CR258 â RCRF for Secondary Device 
   - Verizon VoLTE/LTE Outbound Roaming

   The following projects are mine:
    - Trans Union Credit Decisioning (EAGR) 
    - Voice over WiFi 
    - IR0583 â Stand-Alone ESIM Provisioning 
    - PCRF Forklift Project  
    - IR0600 â 5G Commercialization 
    - IR0596 â International Services Revamp 
    - Verizon VoLTE/LTE Outbound Roaming
  
  I will attend all meetings, ask questions, confer with my Peers and keep my leader updated on the ongoing progress.

  - EGAR
    Become the go to person for both Trans-Union and Fraud. This will be done by studying existing documentation and careful analysis of the logs (including OSB) and reports and help with the playbook if asked. 
  - Learn Python by creating monitors (if appropiate), self study and mentoring.  
  - Create more monitors and add them to the EPS monitors. Some ideas I have is the following:
    - IP usage Check :: Combine both Mr. Smith's and my monitors together to create a graphic that shows the IP prepay usage.
    - Usage Check :: A screen to query an MDN which brings back all information for the customer associated to to that MDN.
    We have a lot of good monitors that are buried in emails and I would like to take some and give them grater visability.
  - Expand knowledge in GITHUB by giving a presentation and cheet sheet on how to use GITHUB for both source control and collaboration.

** Project Description
   On July 29, U.S. Cellular will begin offering High-Speed Internet Fixed Service, supported by the 
   Outdoor High-Speed Internet (HSI) D-Link Unit, to eligible customers in Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa markets. 
   This device is a professionally installed, externally mounted outdoor unit. Paired with the Google Wi-Fi Mesh 
   indoor router, it provides 2X faster speeds compared to the internal D-Link Router and provides an extended 
   range even at the edge of U.S. Cellularâs coverage areas.

** Project Description
  Devices during and beyond 2018 will have traditional SIM replaced by eSIM (GSMA based) for both Postpaid and
  Prepaid. USCC currently has no solution to provision these devices in standalone mode. Within the next 5 years,
  Device Marketing is forecasting that all devices (handsets, tablets, wearables, etc.) will only support eSIM.
  This initiative will provide the ability to activate eSIM capable devices (either primary or secondary devices)
  through the Point of Sale (PoS) system. When the eSIM is on a secondary device, the system will support the
  provisioning and assignment of the âOne Numberâ feature so that the secondary device and the primary device
  that it is paired with can make and receive phone calls and messaging using the same mobile number for
  Postpaid.
  [[file:docs/Vision%20and%20Scope%20-%20eSIM_v1.8.pdf][Vision and Scope]]
** Go Live Dates
   - Apple 09/20/2019
   - Samsung 09/09/2019
** Possible Billing Issues
   It all depends on the range of the eSIM devices. We already support eSIM for secondary devices, Apple Watch, 
   and if the eSIM range is within the range for those watches, usage will be dropped.
** Monitors/Controls/Alerts and Ownership 
   Need to watch for any drop in usage for Apple devices.
** Status 
   Questions about how provisioning will be done with secondary devices and primary devices that have eSIM.
   *UAT in Progress*
   - A IR0583 â eSIM Consumer Enable-meant Track 2 - Secondary Device Activation Impact Assessment (IA) is waiting approval (Still Waiting).
   - Reporting, what to report on, was this weeks hot topic.
   - eSIM Consumer Enable-meant Track 2 document  has been released and ready for review. 
   The dual SIM devices are not working as expected. All other devices will be launched on September 27.
** Current Status    
   No updates this week.

** Project Description
  *PCRF - Policy and Charging Rules Function* works along side  
  *Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF)* and *Online Charging System (OCS)* 
  interact and charge for subscriber services. These interactions include subscriber login, 
  service updates to existing sessions, connection and monitoring, and subscriber 
  termination and logout.

  [[https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/pcrf-pcef-ocs-interactions-understanding.html][Understanding Interactions Between the PCRF, PCEF, and OCS]]

  This project will replace our current *PCRF* by *OpenNet* to a new version by *CISCO*.
  The servers themselves are clustered linux environments and 
  will deployed in *Santa Clara, Atlanta, Schumacher and Ashton* starting in May and ending in July.
  The software itself is broken up into components such as policy server/director, 
  session managers. The configuration information held in a *MongoDB* document database.
  The system configuration are done via Excel spreadsheets for the major options and a Web
  frontend called *CPS* for finer tuning. There is also a monitoring tool called *Grafana* 
  which provides system dashboards for monitoring.
** Go Live Dates
   5/01/2019 - 7/01/2019
** Monitors/Controls/Alerts and Ownership
   Need to monitor the network traffic when the switchover occurs to make sure usage does not drop.
** Status
   In preparation for 5G, the old *AAA* servers will be retired and replaced. I've contacted the project owners to warn them that they need to make sure that the servers IP has been added to the *PC9_IP_ADDR_LIST* table.
** Current Status
   With the replacement of the ols servers with the new, I found that they were not replacing the forward facing IP's, so no need to update the *PC9_IP_ADDR_LIST* table.

  [[file:Pictures/IR0596%20-%20International%20Services%20Revamp%20Mind%20map.pdf][Project Mind Map]]
  This project is to provide extra services for our post-paid international
  customers which will include:
  1. Package Offers for Roaming Services
  2. Usage Notifications
  3. Policy Controls
  4. Day Passes for Roaming Services
  5. Country Code Rezoning
  A project such as this would usually take between 6 to 8 months
  to complete other than that no specific deployment date has been given.
   1. API enhancements:
    - Syniverse API is EOL and we will need to enhance our APIâs to support the newly upgraded Syniverse API
      - Implement this with proper validations and ensure proper upgrade/migration strategy to minimize the current business flows.
    - Roam Monitor notifications can be removed with proper assessment but not the Welcome notification
      - Welcome notification will still function as BAU
    - Amdocs work will mostly be Compilation change with proper assessment and re-coding of API.
   2. Policy Controls:
    - Currently, international data captured by Vodafone and Syniverse measures this data after receiving from Vodafone. 
      - A batch file will be sent to USCC from Syniverse with the measured data
    - We will need policy controls for Voice and SMS in addition to data
      - TAP records from Syniverse will come in a batch feed and Mediation team processes these batch files
    - The voice batch feed will be sent every 4 hours
    - *The usage file received from Syniverse must be compared TOPS usage by USCC IS team(s) and trigger a notification to the customer based on the business rules*
      - Data throttling will also be dependent on the policies that will be defined and the notifications to the customer will be sent accordingly.
    - There are no Revenue Impacts
    - Once the customer completes the data as defined in their package, they will have to move into pay as you go rates. There will be no throttling at this time but after certain business triggering events, we need to start throttling.
      - Need to send notifications as applicable and based on current systems technical flows
      - These need to be part of BRD and IS user stories
    - Barring of voice and SMS and the triggering events needs to be expanded.
   3. PITS/PRITS
    - We need to accumulate Voice and SMS usages in addition to Data
    - There is a  Data PIT that we can leverage for this project
    - There is an existing PIT for voice as well but we need to confirm to make sure on this  and if feasibility exists perform some testing to validate 
   4. Plans and Offers
    - New $15 and $35 plans will be created for respective countries
    - No new enhancements or charge codes or tax impacts or revenue recognition impacts for Accounting and Revenue Assurance teams
   5. Country Code rezoning
    -  Rezoning of country codes will be implemented based on business definitions.
   6. Reporting
    -  We need to regression test *Roaming Reconciliation Report*
    -  Any new reporting requirements will need to flow through business teams (Enterprise BA)
** Go Live Dates
   - Track 1 GSM Country Code Rezoning June 23rd
   - Track 2 API Upgrade August 18th
   - New price plans will be rolled out on the November 3th release.
** Possible Billing Issues
   - No impact to billing since we process this data already. 
** Monitors/Controls/Alerts and Ownership
   I believe this will be business as usual but it is to early to tell.
** Status
   When the project is launched there will be new $25-35 price plans 
   Syniverse will be sending files 4 times daily, instead of once.
   - New company and leader documentation has been created explaining the implications of this project.
   - Track 3 IA pending Approval
   - Track 2 IA is now final
   - USCC TOPS IA IR0596 Track 3 - International Services Data Barring (Pending Approval)
   - USCC TOPS IA IR0596 Track 2- Intn'l Services - Notifications and Billing Offers Impact Assessment (IA) (Final)
   - CR 1059 for IR0596 - International Services Revamp has been created title: EDW Work Transition.
   - New International billing offers have been created and waiting approval
   The status of CR 876 for IR0596 - International Services Revamp has been changed to "Approved" (Intl Service Revamp - Track 2 Scope Change 
   (Policy Control Voice/SMS Barring/Unbarring) ). 
   - CR#876 We are removing from this scope of work Voice/SMS barring & unbarring for Policy Controls. This solution is depended on a 3rd party vendor at this time and we were unable to find an adequate solution.
   - USCC TOPS IA IR0596 Track 2- Intn'l Services - Notifications and Billing Offers has been approved
   No Meeting this week but a CR has been approved.
   The status of CR 876 for IR0596 - International Services Revamp has been changed to "Approved" (Intl Service Revamp - Track 2 Scope Change (Policy Control Voice/SMS Barring/Unbarring) ).  All changes requested in the CR may now be implemented.
** Current Status
   The underlying work needed for this project is complete. The last update talks of the new billing offers that will be rolled out.

** Project Description
   The objective of this project is to implement WPS
   (Wireless  Priority Service) on USCC âs LTE network with a
   limited capability (LC) by September 13th , 2019.
** Go Live Date
   January 19, 2020
** Open Issues
   None
** Billing and Revenue impacts
   None that I can see but the project is just begining.
** Old Status
   We are working thru the logistics now and we will identify who will need to attend the testing as required or on call.
   Traceability matrix has been created.
** Previous Status    
   - Due to outstanding issues involving Engineering, this project is now off track and will jeopardize the planned 9/13 release.
   - HLD v1.0 has been just released and being reviewed.
   USCC TOPS IA IR0614 WPS on VoLTE has been approved.
   1. IS target dates/aligned â Approved âPI 32 Jan 2020 Release IS development schedule is ON TRACK.
   2. Project schedule is OFF TRACK.   
      a. Project is OFF TRACK for schedule (Path to green -Revised ENG solution, schedule and alignment with GDIT on the approved schedule/timeline).   Of the 3 open issues, ENG has resolved 1. The GETS Call issue has been successfully tested in production.  The remaining 2 are open items.  For the OpenNet PCRF issue ENG investigated and learned the ARP value on the PCRF is a global value. Changing the ARP value will impact regular E911 calls.  OpenNet PCRF is being used for BOTH vEPC and commercial networks.  ENG is assessing the impact to making a change. The last open item is the Samsung fix for the *272911 issue; Samsung is to provide us an update by 10/3.  GDIT did provide a retesting date of 10/15 and DHS/GDIT testing target of 10/29-10/30 - USCC pending agreement of these dates based on resolution of 2 open  issues.

    9. State that the new Market areas will support VOLTE only. Has tax implications
    - Part 2 of the user stories has been completed.
    - New company codes will be created for the new market areas. The company codes are 808 (Northern Wisconsin) and 809 (Sioux City, Iowa).
    - EDW tables will be updated for the new Company Codes.
    - The new number ranges for the market expansion areas will be loaded for use by Number Management.
    - The SID/BID for Northern Wisconsin is 45786. The SID/BID for Sioux City, IA is 45785.
    - CDRs will accurately indicate the SIDs/BIDs and call routing in the expanded market areas. 
    - USCC will expand its coverage area in Northern Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, and Nebraska. No new switches are required. Approximately 70 cell sites will be added in the new market areas.
    User Stories have been Accounting has been added and awaiting review.
    Continuing with the User stories...
    - Susan talked to Daniel Lee this morning from Cindy Nangleâs team about the A/R changes that will be required.  Daniel sent an email, which indicated who the business contact has been that should provide the information for the new stores.  Bob will reach out to Eric (from the email).  The Middleware team will install the changes.
    - Kazim made the MT change, but more information from the business needs to be delivered to Kazim.  Bob will reach out to Bernard Cottone from the Real Estate Team.  There was one store with an incorrect address.  These changes can go in earlier than January with no issues.  Bernard should open a new ticket.
    - Shweta will not have any development changes for this project.
    - Robyn is working on the spreadsheet of tables to be changed (the tables came from the IA).  She will have most of it done by noon today.  There are some tables that are not BPT tables.  The team will discuss these at an 8:30 meeting tomorrow (Susan cannot attend).   
    - Testing will make progress on their HLCâs after the IA has been approved.  Testing will most likely start after the certified code drop on 12/6.  ETQA will consider starting testing earlier â on the uncertified code. Revenue Recognition wanted to get the build to begin their testing.  If there are defects in testing, fixes will be pushed as hot fixes. 
    Robyn Deike said that all EPC/BPT table development is now complete except for the following:
    - JGL updates: per emails, I will plan to deliver to Amdocs by EOD today, then Amdocs will deliver their part as a HF on top of the build in a few days.
    - PC9_IP_ADDR_LIST: per emails, it seems like no updates, but there is not yet any firm verification. If we find updates are needed, I will deliver as HF on top of the build.
    - CR1156: this is the eligibility rules updates (EPC); once approved I will do this work and it can be delivered as an EPC HF on top of the build. 
    - APRM: per emails, it is not clear yet who owns making these updates; if it ends up being BPT then I will need to deliver as a HF on top of the build.

Discussion Points \ Notes (from agenda above):  
 - CR1156 to update the EPC eligibility rules for new markets was approved, and Robyn will make the changes in EPC and apply a hot fix to the ETQA environments.  Robyn will wait until all of the ETQA environments have been identified for this project.  She is targeting to apply a hot fix next week.
 - Regarding the ETQA environments, SQT23 and SQT42 were already identified as the environments that will be used for Market Expansion.  Steve said that one more environment is required, and he will send out the environment once it is determined.  (NOTE:  Steve sent emails after the meeting confirming that SQT22/DEX2 and SQT36 will also be used for testing.  This information was sent to the development teams.)     
 - Steve said that some of the tests are currently missing because Amdocs created the test cases from the IA and not the User Stories.  Rev Rec test cases were not specified.  Steve told Dave L that there are not any test cases to determine if CDMA and prepaid devices can be supported.  This is acceptable.  Dave said that the new stores will not be stocking CDMA devices, but it was agreed early on in the project that there would not be any requirements for TOPS to restrict CDMA devices.  This would have impacted the timeline and budget of Market Expansion.  Mary will bring this up at her track lead meeting tomorrow.  Mary said that prepaid VoLTE has not yet launched, but these stores should support prepaid.  Mary is going to check in with the prepaid VoLTE team in a week or so to see if they are going to launch before the expanded market stores will open.
 - Robyn asked about updates to the zip code list.  Mary said that the updated list is targeting delivery this Friday, and she will see that it is delivered to Robyn.  Robyn will let Steve and Margaret know when the hot fix to update the zip code list is going to the test environments.
 - Regarding whether or not there needs to be updates to the PC9_IP_ADDR_LIST table, Mary will follow up with Inez to see if there is an answer to this question yet.
 - Susan followed up with Ankush on whether the APRM changes were made yet.  He responded by email that he is still working on this.  Susan will follow up again later this week.  Steve said that the testers will need to have these permissions on or before 12/9.
 - Daniel said that the AR changes will be complete by the end of this week.  He will produce two files that will need to be deployed by the Middleware team.  Steve and Daniel will work together to get the files deployed.
 - Shweta said that the Logic_dev changes are done, and she will submit a request for a hot fix after all of the environments have been identified.
 - Kazim will rebuild the MT changes for the test environment when all of the environments have been determined.
 - The hot fix for the JGL changes was delivered, and Steve will work with Limor to get the hot fix deployed to the test environments.  The file from Amdocs with all JGL information was sent to the Tax Team.
 - The emails from Margaret and Steve were similar - just formatted differently.  There will be one new scenario for the Website GEO locations.  Steve will work with ETQA folks to see if he can get the Rev Rec and SCM test scenarios done earlier than previously communicated.  He will know by the end of this week.
 - Mary said that Tony Maravola is the project UAT lead.  He will work with Steve and Margaret on the type of UAT that will be needed.  Steven from MCSO has suggested that the team do a BVT the week of 2/10 prior to the opening of the stores.  
 - Mary requested that Eric Conlon be included on the HLC emails. 
    - We havenât added new codes using the APRM tool.  Serhiy created a procedure document to add codes, which is attached.  
    - Amdocs cannot add the codes because the APRM Online (Tool) is a GUI based tool that needs access in Production.
    - The project team recommends Intra-Company Settlement business owner (Renae Grob and Michail Koynoff from Accounting) to add the company codes in production.  The new codes would need to be added prior to the launch of Market Expansion in January. We have the How To Guide from Amdocs. 
    1. Action Item: For Amdocs and our SAM team to ensure that the business team will be able to access APRM Online tool in production. 
       - Adding new company codes is similar to adding new partners (Intercarrier Services does this).  New partners get added by the business team and hence project team recommends modeling business operation the same way. 
       - There is value in testing this in the ETQA environments.  
    2. Action Item: ETQA to identify the environment that is used for testing. Amdocs Dev team will ensure that the environment can support APRM Online (Tool) for adding company codes and following the How To Guide in ETQA to validate the process will work in production. For resources, ETQA can rely on Amdocs Testing Team for validating the How To Guide Process. If there are security/permission issues for ETQA resources, project team will be notified for issue resolution. 
       - The team will discuss with Robyn (EPC/BPT) or Dave Balchen (IS Operations Lead) to see what role they would like to play for project work and for ongoing operations when it comes to managing business parameter tables (for e.g. company codes) in the APRM module for intra-company roaming.  
       - We will need to log a decision if adding the codes is not tested in the test environments.  Nikhil can help with a write up if that is what we will be doing.

    The big news this week is that we do not need to add to the *PC9_IP_ADDR_LIST* table since new forwarding IP's are not needed.
    No updates due to the Holidays
    No meetings this week
** Current Status 
   Moved in dormant mode to production in the January release. Expecting to turn in on in mid February.

    We are currently in test mode and I've had to do several searches within the *rated events table* to verify the results.    
    Mala is on vacation till the end of the year, thus no updates.
    There was much discussion on the Special Numbers Table and how it retains to Pre-pay. It was decided that there should change to the *SCP* to grant pre-pay customers access to customer care.
    They are continuing testing and have found an issue and will discuss it next meeting. I have also been tasked filling out the ITSM support readiness form, which needs to be completed by January 13th (Universe Creation Day!!!)
    ITSM document is finished. Found an issue with the volume field from the test calls. 
    Key Dates:
      - January release â 1/19/2020
      - Feb offcycle â 2/12/2020
      - Commercialization (with Market launch)â 2/14/2020
    - IR539 and related CRs below for Prepaid functionality are on hold and will not be going in the January release.
    - *For CR 846 and CR971 â Postpaid functionality only will be delivered in the January release; Prepaid on hold until mid Feb
    - Targeted* Timelines for CR1221 and CR1245: 
      - Code Delivery â 2/3
      - ETQA testing â 2/4 to 2/11
      - Delivery â 2/12
      - *these dates will need to be confirmed by Amdocs after IA is approved, as well with ETQA
    Lots of Issues still need to be addressed. Went through the ITSM document.
    Created two new alerts for the following issues:
    1. Long duration
    2. Bad Sids
** Current Status 
   - The project is complete. Besides the two new alerts, I created a daily report that is sent to various business groups that show all Pre-Paid VoLTE calls over 60 minutes.

** EpsMonitors
   The EPS monitors is a monitoring solution developed by the IS Billing Operations team. 
   On each machine monitored there is a server which runs a select number of scripts then stores that information in memory.
   A Tomcat web server retrieves the information, formats it and then displays.
   
   The EpsMonitors are located on all production servers listed in the diagram below and can be 
   found at */apps/amduser/prodtc*/eps/EpsMonitors*, *where * = 1-6*
   You need to login using your own lanID then sudo /bin/su - prodtc(1....6)

** Check Production servers.
   There is a script located in the home directory of the user *calldmp* on the *kpr01scd01* called *CheckEPS_MonitorPorts*
    that will check each production server to see it is operational. If successful it will display "/Howdy from the MPS Monitor/"
    if not it shows *Fail*

** Restart the Monitor(s)
   When a monitor is down you need to go into the host server using your lanID then sudo /bin/su - prodtc* where * = 1..6 then got to the *eps/EpsMonitor/* directory.
   Once there run the script *StartMonitors* which will start the monitor.

** Project Manager
   Parhas, Colleen
** Description
   This project is to enable Google Fiber customers access to the VoLTE network and Enhanced Calling Services.
** Status
   Held first meeting on October 17th nothing since.
   Solution Proposel 1 and 2 have been created and on 11/18 Googles responded that the solution is acceptable.
   No updates. Sent Kevin Bengtson a message for an update.
   The project is reporting off track overall and for scope for the week of 2/21. The USCC team cannot move forward with the build out of the network architecture 
   and of the technical solution until Google provides clear requirements for customer experience. The USCC team investigated the option of using U.S. Cellular's 
   VoLTE customer experience to reverse engineer the requirements but feels that this could be risky and result in throwaway work. 
   Business requirement work has been put on hold until the team can better understand what Google can offer in terms of customer experience requirements. 
   The project will return to green once USCC and Google agree on a path forward to document business requirements

     2. Swetha - What prefixes are being added to current calls? 
     3. Swetha - Indicator for International Calls for RLC. 
     4. Sarit - confirm these records are not going through APRM?
     5. Sarit â Confirm Logic can be updated to reference only the last 10 digits on the number to ignore for rating .
     6. Michelle â Confirm with the business if we expect using this number for International Roaming to impact the volume of calls.

** Project Description
   USCC customers need support IoT application requiring the deployment of low power devices with long range coverage.  The customer applications also require the ability to support OTA upgrade of constraints devices. Some of these constraint devices require USCC to support SMS over NAS feature to enable OTA upgrades in the field. 
   Without the implementation of these features, constrained devices requiring OTA upgrade, long range coverage and operating in PSM, eDRX modes cannot be supported in the USCC network.
** Status
   Held the the first meeting to go through the solution document.
   FP&A has completed the business case. In the event that a business case is deemed not necessary or can be completed at a later time.
   The project is just in the preliminary mode so there has been no standing meetings.
   The solution document has been produced and is currently under review.
   This is an engineering project and should not affect IT.

** Project Manager
   Kirti Parikh
** Project Description
   The commercialization of *5G* is part of the following:
   - Network enable-meant in Year 1 markets (Iowa and Wisconsin)
   - New *TOPS* functionality to support *5G* Provisioning and Usage processing
   - Launch of new *5G* enabled devices (multiple platforms and device types)
   - NDC will be rolling out a new version of there mediation software which will help with some of the issues with being able to distinguish between 5G and 4G.
   - The introduction documents have been disseminated out in the field.
** Go Live Dates
   Delivery Schedule (Kirti)
   - Track1 â TOPS Provisioning changes (Amdocs) â 1 PI effort â 1 User story
     - Deployment Phase Complete - 11/3/2019 (COMPLETE)
   - Track2 â TOPS Charging changes (PDC) â TBD â dependency on data refinery
     -  Deployment Phase Complete - 3/10/2020
   - Track3 â TOPS MOA changes â Per user stories, MOA will be needed on demand basis, there is dependency on Engineering.
   - Reporting Enable-meant for 5G will be part of future track of work as aligned with Business.
   - Expect to be finished sometime 2020
** Open Issues
   Open items we are tracking (Team)
   - Network Modernization -  5G Data Usage Report, IS has dependency on data refinery for this report
   - 5G capable (device) reporting and charging will be part of track 2.2 work scope. Dave Smith and Dave Balchen from Billing Operations will be engaged. SANDS team will be engaged as well.
   - WE (Web Evolve project) changes to 5G (MyAcoount)
   - Suspension of VoLTE Subscriptions  email from Brian(attached below): "Very recently on CDMALESS project we identified that in specific cases there will be a negative customer experience because of our approach for suspending VoLTE.  As a reminder, current state is when we suspend a VoLTE enabled subscription VoLTE is disabled and deleted from all related VoLTE elements and the device relies on CDMA for calls to 611 and financial services hot lining.
   In the case of 5G we are systematically preventing disablement of VoLTE, it would seem in current solution approach 5G has same issue (when a customer is suspended they will not have the ability to call 611/Customer Service from suspended device)."  We will discuss and assess impact at the team meeting.
 
** Billing and Revenue impacts:  
   - *Reporting :* Depending on the detail reporting requirements, *5G* usage must be separated 
   from *4G* usage. Mediation will make this separation and the system to process this usage
   will depend on the detail requirements. This would require reading data from the CallDump.
   - *WeDo reporting :* An attempt will be made to minimize impact to the *WeDo Rev Assurance tool*
   by keeping the *WeDo* feed as pure *KB* usage without separation of *4G vs 5G* CDRs. 
   The same principle will be adopted when sending usage to *TOPS*. TOPS usage will be
   combined *4G+5G Kb* in the *UFF* records.
   - *Turbocharging :* Validation will be required when the enhanced core is available 
   for test. We need to ensure that the interface to the *P/SGWs* remains intact.
   - *5G Phones* Must be *VoLTE* enabled.
** Monitors/Controls/Alerts and Ownership
   Mr. Smith's IP monitors may need to be changed to look for 5G.
** Status
   - USCC TOPS IA IR0600 - 5G Commercialization has been Approved.
   - Mr. Hauk has sent out the various proposals on the 5G usage which includes:
     - *No changes* 5G and 4G together indistinguishable from each other.
     - *5G based on 4G* Take the 4G LTE record and modify for 5G
     - *5G Usage in 5G-NR Record Type* Where 2 records are produced 1 for 4G and 1 to 5G.    
   - 5G Phase 2 Business requirements first draft is complete. This will cover reporting and data verification (We will have a bigger roll).
   - Solution Document for phase 1 has been updated.
   - Currently tracking the Track2 scoping time-line from Amdocs. Conducting weekly meetings with IS and Engineering teams 
     to look at lab readiness road-map as well as initial UE samples that may become available for lab and/or field trials.
     Leveraging action-item repository in the enterprise share point site for items we need addressed by IS and Engineering teams.
   - The project status is on track from IS perspective for January 2020 release.
   - Currently tracking the Track2 scoping time-line from Amdocs. Conducting weekly meetings with IS and Engineering 
     teams to look at lab readiness road-map as well as initial UE samples that may become available for lab and/or field trials.
     Leveraging action-item repository in the enterprise share-point site for items we need addressed by IS and Engineering teams.
   - Resolved and closed commenting of Track1 IDD. Continued IS ETQA functional and regression testing for track1 work.
     Reviewed and finalized UAT scenarios. Attended Performance test review meeting - there is low performance impact for Track-1 changes.
     Participated in on-going IS and Engineering weekly discussion on open action items. Received confirmation from SANDS team that
     track1 reports will be delivered Dec 6th, 2019. Capability C2 will be functionally tested in the TOPS changes for October release with option 1:
     Partially certify the HSS/AAM interfaces without 5G Commercial device, and non-availability of 5G lab.
   - Conducted weekly meeting with IS and Engineering teams to look at lab readiness roadmap as well as initial CDR samples that may become available for lab and/or field trials.
   - Continued impact analysis of solution between Engg and IS PDC 5G usage identification logic.
   - Met with Amdocs to discuss solution approach and re-prioritization of 5G capabilities. Next step to updated ROM from Amdocs which will inform us about short term and also long term approach. 
   - Further assessment is needed before we can re-establish the timelines for User Stories updates, review and approval of User Stories, IA update, review and approvals.
   - Re stakeholder an alternative approach and timeline if needed and finalize next steps.
   - The key dependency for Track2 and subsequent tracks of work is IS and Engg Secondary RAT 5G usage designs with the underlying CDR processing which needs to be resolved first.
   - The project status is On track for November release. Below capability will be delivered in this release: 
         Capability C1: 5G Capable EPC changes/ Regular Provisioning via LTE/VoLTE devices.
   - The project status is On track for November release. Below capability will be delivered in this release: Capability C1: 5G Capable EPC changes/ Regular Provisioning via LTE/VoLTE devices
   - The project status is Off Track from IS perspective for January 2020 release. Architecture re-prioritization of capabilities in progress. The Risk report reported last week regarding Engg and IS PDC 5G usage identification logic has been re-opened.
   Track 1 - The project status is On track for November release. Below capability will be delivered in this release: Capability C1: 5G Capable EPC changes/ Regular Provisioning via LTE/VoLTE devices
   Track 2 - The project status is Off Track from IS perspective for January 2020 release. Architecture re-prioritization of capabilities in progress. 
   The Risk regarding Engg and IS PDC 5G usage identification logic needs to be resolved before project can return to On Track status.
   The RAT report is wrong and they need to start from square one.
   Concerns from team:
   - EnodeB needs to be available with the updated software versions for LTE test devices to attach
   - ETQA will test using LTE device for Oct/Jan release, and will need to retest after Device is available (3/12/20) and this increases a possibility of a Amdocs CR
   - Track 2 scope is dependent on the 5G usage report and the mechanics for IS to design and deliver appropriately. Risk to schedule and designs if the unknowns are not resolved to the extent best possible
   - A CR to be created for retesting efforts and will be assessed as needed
 
   Delivery Schedule (Kirti)
   - Track1 â TOPS Provisioning and MOA changes (Amdocs EPC) â 1 PI effort â 5 User stories â  Accepted in PI 30 for Nov 2019 major release, Amdocs delivered code in drop1, testing in progress.
   - Track2 â TOPS Charging changes (PDC and Amdocs). This track also includes Reporting Enable-meant â dependency on ieCCF enhancements needs to be resolved. 
 
   PDC team is completely blocked by the dependency for the RAT report being resolved. This is Action item # 7 and is raised as a Risk in the project. PDC team needs several meetings after this is met, before they can solution and move forward. This will impact timeline for January delivery.
   Procurement policy for devices - when production ready devices are available (in Dec?) how would PDC and ETQA get access to those? Do we need funding? Do we need to borrow or purchase devices? Need timeline for that.
   - The project status is On track for November release. Below capability will be delivered in this release: Capability C1: 5G Capable EPC changes/ Regular Provisioning via LTE/VoLTE devices
   - The project status is Off Track from IS perspective for January 2020 release. Architecture re-prioritization of capabilities in progress. The Risk regarding Engg and IS PDC 5G usage identification logic needs to be resolved before project can return to On Track status.
   Here is a list of defects that were discussed in this weeks meeting:
   - Defect 140871 - Connected 5G Device Volte Defaults to âNoâ and When Changed to âYesâ in Order Flow Result is VoLTo âNoâ
   - Defect 140796 -Issue with pop up not appearing when 5G Capable Indicator is modified within order in TOPS.
   - Defect 140788 - Incompatible SIM card version for VoLTE. *(possibly just a data issue, but waiting on resolution)
   - Defect 140814 - During add a line flow, user can toggle Volte Enabled Indicator to âNoâ
   - Defect 140817 - User is able to toggle 5G capable indicator during ESN swap for existing line.

   The project status is On track for November release. Below capability has been delivered in this release: 
   Capability C1: 5G Capable EPC changes/ Regular Provisioning via LTE/VoLTE devices
   - Scheduled technical meetings to work on the 5G reporting.
   - Once aligned next steps will be Architecture updates and Use stories.
   - Working with business on the schedule and dates for the 5G reporting availability. Currently Trending Q2 2020.
   - Track 1 is complete and in deployment.
   - Track 2 scheduled to be deployed 2nd quarter 2020.
     Conducted technical meeting with Architecture, IM, PDC and other impacted IS team to begin work on the 5G reporting.
     Once aligned next steps will be Architecture updates and Use stories.
     Working with business on the schedule and dates for the 5G reporting availability. Currently Trending Q2 2020.
   - Track1 is Closed. 
 
   - Track2 Scope and target date is TBD due to 5G RAT reporting limitations and constraints.
 
   - After discussions with all impacted IS teams as well as Business and Engineering, architecture direction points to Reporting solution.
 
   - This is driven by the fact that accurate 5G usage cannot be deduced from NR secondary RAT usage compared to combined 4G+5G. We are waiting for data accuracy before taking any further action on this topic.
 
   - Next Steps:
     - Revisit the deck and the options towards the 5G Reporting Only approach
     - Architecture document and direction update
     - Ensure the PDC team has right information with requirements and designs to carry out the next steps
     - Follow up on whether a new source for 5G usage will be set up for the EDW 
     - Move forward with delivery planning 
 
   - Open items: 
     - Device availability - Crystal has the info, processing NDA for PDC and ETQA
     - User stories updates - Placeholder meeting 12/16/19
     - Meeting with CXM team - 12/19/19

   5G Phase1:\\
    All identified open issues should be revisited based on the Action item log/Emails exchanges if any.
    Set up one more meeting with engineering leads to discuss further this week or early next week. Sooner the better
    - First we will review the IS issues and dependencies
    - Next we can check on additional device/engineering specs that can impact E2E cases

    E2E test strategy and validations should cover the combined 4G+5G usage scenarios and prepare for 5G Commercial Launch
    - Led by mediation team to uncover any issues on first pass. Essentially help to understand the downstream systems feeds  Fraudx, Calldump, TOPS etc.
    - Include any formal test scenarios as we have the 5G devices now and ensure the TOPS flows are not impacted
    - Possible regression of Phase1 scope that includes the EPC 5G rules etc and any functional flows

    Email to Fraudx team and ask them to check on the following as needed
    - Whenever PDC team ready with their test for 4G+5G usage records validations 
    - Fraudx team to validate their flows with any ETQA support

    5G Phase2:
    - Reporting track of work and the next steps should be followed up on.
    - As discussed additional scope items will be updated to the team

    Status update for 5G Launch preparation:
    - Any critical open items from IS end with E2E dependencies should be part of launch efforts.
   Track 2 - 5G Commercialization - The scope of this track includes Charging related flows to identify and adapt the new 5G data usage record structures. 
   Monitor the CDRâs for charging validations and opportunity to look at the new 5G parameters to distinguish the usage based on the network raw CDRâs 
   with Secondary RAT (Radio Access Technology) usage reports and relevant parameters. Ensure the existing Gy interface for online charging flows 
   are not impacted with 5G EPC core changes.
   IS PDC team continued the Device testing in lab and shared the results with Business and project team. 
   - IS teams continue to monitor the secondary RAT issues.
   - EDW Design is in progress.
   - IS team continued to explore options for the Racine Media event on 02/22/2020 in case IS Support is needed.
   *The project status is Off Track for Schedule of Reporting delivery in Q2 2020.*
    - Provided extensive IS Support for the Racine Media event which took place on 2/26/20.
    - Combined 4G + 5G Usage: It was determined that the default aggregate reporting is not changing and will still be accurate. Decision # 655 is logged to close out that issue.
    - Secondary RAT issues - it is currently determined that secondary RAT reports remain problematic and engineering is well aware of that. Until engineering works with their 
      vendors to implement a solution to resolve these concerns, this is a watch item for IS.
    - EDW Design is in progress for the Reporting solution to be delivered in June 2020. There will be additional work to model how we structure this data in the EDW presentation layer.
    - Splitting 4g-5G Traffic - Ericsson dependency â Engineering team and leaders are aware.
    - ETQA and EPC team are engaged on the Production Test SKU issue. The fix will be in production 3/26 â Work around is in place in the meantime.
   
   *Upcoming Activities*
   - Assess and address CR # 1291 for Testing Speed Change. Update maximum bandwidth value provisioned in the HSS by TOPS to allow no speed limiting for LTE or 5G testing. 
     Currently we "cap" speeds for testing at 100 Mbps. New 5G devices are capable of significantly faster speeds both Uplink and Downlink.  We need to be able to test 
     those devices at higher speeds. Initially we believed the 100 Mbps would be sufficient.
   - Engage SANDS team in reporting sessions.
   - Solicit implementation schedule from the EDW Reporting team.
   - Support any issues that come up for launch.

   *Phase 1 of 5G has been implimented and in production (Iowa and Wisconsin) and there have been no issues so far.* 
   Received a âgoâ decision from the executive team to launch our 5G devices. Began Live BMC on 03/04.
   - Provided assessment for CR # 1291 - Update default Downlink Speed. Due to new 5G device capabilities being more than current maximum speed limits 
     the request is to update Downlink maximum bandwidth value provisioned in the HSS by TOPS to allow 4Gbps for LTE.
   - EDW Design is in progress for the Reporting solution to be delivered in June 2020. There will be additional work to model how we structure this data in the EDW presentation layer.
   - ETQA and EPC team are engaged on the Production Test SKU issue. The fix will be in production 3/26 â Work around is in place in the meantime.
   - Secondary RAT issues - it is currently determined that secondary RAT reports remain problematic and engineering is well aware of that. 
     Until engineering works with their vendors to implement a solution to resolve these concerns, this is a watch item for IS.

   - Supported Live BMC from 03/04 - 03/09 in Schaumburg and Virtual BMC starting 03/10. There were no issues reported in the BMC.
   - Development and testing for CR # 1291 continued. This CR is to update default Downlink Speed. Due to new 5G device capabilities 
     being more than current maximum speed limits the request is to update Downlink maximum bandwidth value provisioned in the HSS by TOPS to allow 4Gbps for LTE.
   - EDW Design is in progress for the Reporting solution to be delivered in June 2020. There will be additional work to model how we structure this data in the EDW presentation layer.
   - ETQA and EPC team are engaged on the Production Test SKU issue. The fix will be in production 3/26 â Work around is in place in the meantime.
   - Secondary RAT issues - it is currently determined that secondary RAT reports remain problematic and engineering is well aware of that. Until engineering works with 
     their vendors to implement a solution to resolve these concerns, this is a watch item for IS.
** Current Status 
   - Solution Architecture updates for CR # 1370is in progress. Prepaid was previously out of scope for the initial 5G commercialization launch due to timelines and ability to test prior to device launch.  
     At this time we are looking to expand project scope to include the ability to attach prepaid plans to 5G devices.
   - Met with CXM, IM and EDW teams to discuss sourcing of test data for the reporting solution.
   - ieCCF / Secondary RAT reporting - Meeting is scheduled with IS and Engineering leaders next Monday 4/27.
