 At this point in time Pre-Pay SMS sometimes adds unprintable
 characters to the *APE1\_RATED\_EVENT* table. The following SQL needs
 to be run before the *Billing jobs* can be started to clean up these
 un-printable characters.

 1. First create a temporary table with all of the rated events that
 has a corrupt calling number. *Remember to change the cycle and
 instance to the ones you're working on. In the below 

 :  create table *ape1_rated_event_corrupt_cyc2* nologging as
 :  select a.l9_calling_number,substr(l9_calling_number,0,10) FIXED_CALLING_NUMBER,
 :         a.event_type_id,l9_called_number,source_id,l9_is_online,l9_dialed_digits,
 :         cycle_code,cycle_instance,cycle_year,customer_id,subscriber_id,resource_value,
 :         customer_segment,event_id,start_time from ape1_rated_event a where 1=1 
 :  and REGEXP_LIKE(l9_calling_number, '[^ -~]') 
 :  and l9_calling_number<>' ' 
 :  and event_type_id=54 
 :   and *cycle_code=2* and *cycle_instance=9*
 :  and l3_payment_category <> 'PRE';
    - There could be a possibility that the table we are creating
      already exists, if that is the case *drop table {table name}*
      before running the query.
 2. If you wish to see the result table run the following:
 :  select * from ape1_rated_event_corrupt_cyc2;

 3. Next update the rated event table with the contents of the
    temporary table again remembering to change to the correct temp table.
 : update ape1_rated_event 
 :        set l9_calling_number = substr(l9_calling_number,0,10) 
 : where  (CUSTOMER_ID,SUBSCRIBER_ID,START_TIME,EVENT_ID,CYCLE_CODE,CYCLE_INSTANCE,CUSTOMER_SEGMENT)  in 
 :        (select CUSTOMER_ID,SUBSCRIBER_ID,START_TIME,EVENT_ID,CYCLE_CODE,CYCLE_INSTANCE,CUSTOMER_SEGMENT 
 :        from *ape1_rated_event_corrupt_cyc2*);

It is
Sorry David... Do you want us to rerun th is job when it is up?


12:55 AMBalchen, DavidThis is exciting everything is going to hell!!!
That the usual procedure.. For this type of error
RERUN


12:56 AMMazza, ZacSounds good. I'll note the ticket.


12:56 AMBalchen, DavidOk now to our other problem


12:57 AMMazza, ZacJust sent an e-mail to AMDOCS to see who is on from the TC group
Looks like it's navin tellis, but he's inactive at the moment.


12:58 AMBalchen, DavidIt's Nicola Poppa and he's not answering his phone


12:59 AMMazza, ZacLet me send over another e-mail... we are looking to find out:

Why the three jobs failed and how to continue, and how/if we need to clear out the current maps so that we can resubmit a new EXTRACTS for cycle 8, is that right?


12:59 AMBalchen, DavidYep
Kyle this what I see from your query...
Bear with me I'm going to try something here

YIKES thats ugly
My question is the status = Y what exactly does that mean
Does it mean it's running????


1:05 AMStephan, Kyleit means the map has locked those instances


1:05 AMMazza, ZacSent e-mail... copied you both for awareness.


1:05 AMBalchen, DavidSo can we set them to N???
Is that what you mean by clearing the locks?
or delete the rows
I just got a message from Anil so he's awake


1:07 AMMazza, ZacYeah. Just asked on the bridge... he said he needed 20 minutes
Hi

 

Will check and update

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Navin Tellis



1:10 AMMazza, ZacNavin just came available in chat
I'll see if I can invite him


1:10 AMBalchen, DavidCool..


1:10 AMMazza, ZacInviting now...


1:11 AMBalchen, DavidHello Navin Happy Sunday!!! 


1:11 AMMazza, ZacHello Navin


1:11 AMTellis, NavinHi 


1:12 AMBalchen, DavidNavin.. We have several billing maps fail because the downstream jobs are not getting there parameter files.
Seems like a simple problem to fix but we are unclear on the procedure how to fix
I called my Tier 3 guy but he is not answering his phone


1:14 AMTellis, Navinill check
will update in some time


1:18 AMMazza, ZacYaroslav Kek said he could cancel the maps for us when we were ready...


1:19 AMBalchen, DavidBut is that the right thing to do??? Kyle what do you think.


1:20 AMStephan, Kylewe had a similar situation on Tuesday
worked with Amit to cancel one of the duplicate maps


1:20 AMMazza, ZacHey Navin. The EXTRACTS map is cycle 11897. This is the map we experienced the multiple failures in.


1:20 AMStephan, Kylehe cleaned up something in TC
and then we continued with the other map


1:21 AMBalchen, DavidWell he has yet to share that infoemation with us..
Must be that tier 3 hocus pocus
and how do we get duplicate maps???


1:24 AMStephan, Kylenot sure how the second one got created
either MRO duplicated it or someone in billing didn't understand why it wasn't running
and incorrectly started a second one


1:26 AMBalchen, Davidinteresting


1:28 AMTellis, Navinplease rerun the failed jobs ADJ1RCAEXT and ADJ1OCEEXT


1:29 AMStephan, Kylefrom which map?


1:29 AMTellis, Navini see that ADJ1RCPEXT_X862013_USC_20130921_235403.log is successfull


1:30 AMMazza, ZacIt abended in the map...
Though job log showed successful


1:30 AMTellis, Navinok
ill check the map 


1:35 AMMazza, ZacYaroslav said he is on standby if we need assistance clearing old maps.
Waiting on confirmation Navin on which jobs we need to run from which map... please be aware we have two cycle 8 maps... one from ~ 20:00 CT and one from ~23:00 CT


1:36 AMTellis, Navini think 
BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC 
 
 

is the map
the other map thought activated but none of the jobs have run
though*


1:40 AMTellis, Navinsorry my map wasnt loaded properly... sorry for the confusion
but i think the map i mentioned above would be the appropriate one


1:42 AMMazza, ZacHey Navin.
I've got the following maps with failures?
For cycle 8


1:43 AMStephan, Kyleso do we want to just rerun them from the second, later map?


1:43 AMTellis, Navinok


1:43 AMMazza, ZacBLPREP_Rerun_2720309_amc_20130921.201716_x_205.USC


1:43 AMTellis, Navinthere is one more map
BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC


1:43 AMMazza, Zacand BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC


1:44 AMTellis, Navinyes i think going ahead with this one would be better option


1:44 AMMazza, ZacSo we need to rerun the jobs from the 206 map? 
and BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC?


1:44 AMTellis, Navinyes


1:44 AMMazza, Zacplease rerun the failed jobs ADJ1RCAEXT and ADJ1OCEEXT
Rerunning now from second map
Do we need to do anything with the 205 map?


1:45 AMTellis, Navinthere is one job failed on map 206
rerun that too


1:45 AMMazza, ZacAre you referring to the QA mpa?


1:46 AMTellis, Navinno its with job req X862013


1:47 AMMazza, Zacok
just to confirm


1:47 AMTellis, NavinADJ1PEFNSHN


1:47 AMMazza, Zacfrom map BLPREP_Rerun_1535036_amc_20130921.234426_X_206.USC

** What are you most proud of?
   The wide variaty of and the many new things I've done this year. My slogan for this year has been "Doing things that I have no idea how to do", in which I thought I did a more then adiquete job.
** What challenged you the most?
   The only thing that wasn't as much of a challenge was the changes I made to the CallDump, since I'm very familier with the application.
   Things like the development projects the process was changed and my role changes taking a more advisorly role instaed of a development role.
   Outcollects in particular since all testing and changes needed to be made in production, not to mention we needed to deal with release schedules Moratoriums and outside venders and licensing issues.
** What are your key learnings?
   Don't be afraid to ask questions and also it's is good to make descisions,  because even if it's wrong you will learn from it and eventually come to a solution.
** Associate Strengths
   A good team player with a good working attitude.
** Associate Development Opportunities
   To listen better and not to be intellectually lazy.
** CREATING CUSTOMER VALUE
   /Crafting and implementing world class practices that generate customer value and result in customer advocacy; ensuring that the customer experience is a driving force behind business decisions, activities, and customer offerings./
   I've created customer value by either leading or participating with the following projects.
   1. BPT /Business Process Tables/ \\ I'm in charge with over 28 tables that handle various aspects of the mediation and rating process that need to updated on a regular basis.
   2. CallDump I'm the designer, developer and maintainer of the *CallDump* system that's required by law for us to have. This requires me to handle field inquiies about the results, machine maintainence and code updates and other enhancements.
   3. UFF /The Unified File Format/\\ I'm the SME for our production CDR /Call Detail Record/ format because of this I required to be involved with any new data feeds. This year because of my expertice I was hevily invloved in various projects such as *GSMi* and *Volte*
   4. Outcollects. \\ I was the lead developer, tester for the Outcollect process that was finally moved over to TOPS after 18 months since implimentation.
   5. Development Projects \\I was invloved with the following development projects either as a Reviewr, developer, Approvar or all of the above for the following projects.
      1. Volte - /Approver, Reviewer, Developer/
      2. GSMi  - /Approver, Reviewer, Developer/
      3. Data OutCollects - /Approver, Reviewer, Developer/
      4. BMD Business Verticals - /Approver, Reviewer/
      5. PrePaid Canvas - /Approvar, Reviewer/
      6. Activation Portal - /Approver, Reviewer/
      7. Activation Before Notify Billing - /Approver, Reviewer/
      8. Directory Assistance Handling for CIBER In-collect -  /Approver, Reviewer, Developer/
      9. Incomming Messages - /Reviewer/
      10. Inbound Toll Charge Changes /Reviewer/
** MAKING QUALITY DECISIONS
   I make and take responsabilty for all mydeciesions.   
** COMMUNICATING WITH IMPACT
   /Clearly and succinctly conveying information and ideas to individuals and teams in a variety of situations; communicating with openness and enthusiasm to educate, influence, or move others to action./
   This year has been a big year for communicating concepts and ideas be it knowledge transfer via the WIKI, Change control meetings, development projects or just explaining complicated technical subjects to the business.
** PURSUING AND DEMONSTRATING TECHNICAL/PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE
   This year I was the lead for the Outcollect project where we finally move the Outcollect process to TOPS. In addition we started handleng CIBER 32 (Data) records as well. This not only required learning the data formats but coordinating all aspects of the project.
** APPLYING INNOVATION AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
   I'm always on top of the latest trends in technology and looking for ways to use them to improve our processes.
** COLLABORATING ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES
   /Working across multiple functional disciplines to solve complex business problems and to achieve business goals./
** DELIVERING RESULTS
   In my 14 years being at US Cellular every project I've been associated with my portion has never been delayed, failed or over budget.
** EMBRACING AND NAVIGATING CHANGE
   Nothing makes me happier then to be in situations where I'm needed to find a solution to a problem and that problem is something I've never done before.
** OPERATING WITH A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
   My overall philoaphy in life as well as business has been to understand 
** DEVELOPING TALENT
   I believe I'm a good team member that creates a friendly working environment that helps promote learning and understanding.

  *CIBER* files are a collection of roaming records, these can be
  either a foreign carrier on our network or one of our customers
  on another network. More succinctly there are two
  types of roaming scenarios.
    1. *OutCollects*\\ Non-USCC customers using our network, eventually
       the records created become part of the *Out-Collect* process.
    2. *InCollects*\\ USCC customers roaming on another carriers
       network. These records are sent to Syniverse which in turn
       sends them to us and become part of our *In-Collect* process.

     1. Switch records are passed through the billing system and any
        record that does not belong to a customer gets placed into a file. 
     2. Twice a day the /Ciber\_Create/ job is run which takes these
        files and converts them to CIBER records.
     3. Five times a day *NDC* starts a job which sends these files to
        *Syniverse*.
     4. It also when it looks for CIBER files coming back from
        *Syniverse* of our customers who are roaming on other networks.
   - *Thoughts and other random musings* \\ A pretty simple batch
     interface it is here where we can use the new batch standards to
     make sure the transfer is complete.

  Presently we have a PowerBuilder extract tool which sends this
  information to a *COBOL* program that calculates the entries which is then added to *SAP*.
  - The two primary actions are:
    1. *Daily Journaling*
    2. *ATB - Aged Trial Balance*
  - *Amdocs* has the *G/L Configurator* extracts that can to extract the data needed to be loaded to *SAP*.
    - These extracts also can be downloaded as *EXCEL* Spreadsheets.
  - *Summary Level Accounting* must be done with data from the
    *B/OSS* or a Real-Time *ODS.*
   - *Payments*
     - *CyberSource* is the new *Protobase*
     - All payments happen within the *Accounts Receivable Manager*. 
     - Need to define a new business process for *PrePay*.

   Has many of the CRM UI's to outside collection agencies and banks
   already configured *OOTB[fn:OOTB: Out of the Box]* , and if not, you can use the *Extract UI tool* to create one. By using *APM[fn:APM: Amdocs Process Manager]* we can control format of the collection file.

    - *Collections*
      - At present data is brought back from the *RCV/BCV* where
        trending analysis then takes place. Where they target at risk customers.
      - At present they have 100 collection paths and 25 collection activities.
        - The decisioning engine is done in SAS and the results in the
          *NFSC* database or in the case of the *Dashboard* a *MySql*
          database.
      - The big question is how real-time is this data, because this process needs as close to real-time as you can get.
      - Rebbecca would like two interfaces added for future state.
        - The first is a Real-Time Interface that would talk to a 3rd party, it will be called /Collection Augmentation/.
        - Payment arrangements via the IVR in Real-Time.
        - A widget on the screen that indicates an at risk customer.

   - High Dollar Amount Recovery Procedure
     *IMPORTANT : High Dollar amounts must be reversed on the same day they are created.*

     1. Amdocs OCCGMSCPSGUSCCBOPSAR@amdocs.com receives an
        internal alert indicating there is a high dollar amount
        issue.
     2. Amdocs OCCGMSCPSGUSCCBOPSAR@amdocs.com calls the USC
        Billing On-Call Person from the daily Billing Priorities
        Email as soon as the alert is received.
     3. Amdocs OCCGMSCPSGUSCCBOPSAR@amdocs.com sends an email to
        the USCDLISOps-BillingandAROperations@uscellular.com
        email distribution list within 1 hour of the initial
         internal alert. This email contains:
         -  FA/BAR
         -  transaction_id
         -  amount (e.g. charges_amount)
         -  tax_amount
         -  debit_id
         -  l9_geo_cod
         -  operator_id (associate id)
         -  first_name
         -  last_name
         -  e_mail
         -  employee_no
         -  work_group

     4. USC forwards the Amdocs communication email to the
        following Financial Services email addresses within 1
        hour of receiving the email communication from Amdocs:
        -  NFSC-TulsaResolutions@uscellular.com
        -  NFSCMADFSHelpDesk@uscellular.com
        -  Lane.Dohl@uscellular.com

     5. Financial Services reverses any incorrect transactions
        and replies to the email distribution list for USC and
        Amdocs. If the process is successful, no further action
        is required. If there are any other issues, further
        escalation is needed using our standard processes. This
        escalation requires a Sev-3 ticket created and routed to
        the Amdocs Tier 2 Billing queue.

      *CIBER* files are a collection of roaming records, these can be
      either a foreign carrier on our network or one of our customers on
      another network. More succinctly there are two types of roaming
      scenarios.

      - *OutCollects*\\
      Non-USCC customers using our network, eventually the records
      created become part of the *OutCollect* process.

      - *InCollects*\\
         USCC customers roaming on another carriers network. These
         records are sent to Syniverse which in turn sends them to us
         and become part of our *InCollect* process. All though
         InCollects come pre-rated they are still re-rated according to
         their plan.
\\

               needs to be done to the other 7 tables. For example if it
               is a brand new *SID* all 8 tables need to be updated with
               the most complicated part setting up InCollect and
               OutCollect processing for a *SIDS* contract. The
               following explains in details on what needs to be done:

               1. Find the entry in the *PC9_INCOL_SID_PAIR* where
                  the *SERVE SID* is the contract number and the *HOME
                  SID* = '175' /(USCC contract number)/.

                  1. Expire the date for when you want the new rate to
                     take affect.
                  2. Use the above row as a template for an insert
                     statement.
                  3. *For outcollecs do the same as above except use
                     SERVE SID = '175'*

               2. Create an Insert statement for the
                  *PC9_INCOL_SID_PAIR* with the new rates.
               3. For the OutCollect side find all *SIDS* that that have
                  the *Settlement Contract Code*, /(In this example we
                  trying to find all *SIDS* with settlement contract
                  code = 287)/

              
                  : SELECT SIDS FROM PC9_SID WHERE SETLMNT_CONTRACT_CD = '287';
           

               4. For each *SID* found add '175' to the end and use that
                  as the resource value for the table
                  *AGD1_RESOURCES_REF* then create an insert if it
                  don't exists.

               5. For each *SID* found add a '1' in front which will get
                  you the *customer_id* then do a query against the
                  *APE1_SUBSCR_DATA_REF* to get the subscriber_id

               6. Once you have the subscriber you need to point each
                  entries offer ID's from the
                  *APE1_SUBSCR_OFFERS_REF* table to the correct air
                  and toll charge. /(Again using the above example)/ To
                  find a suitable offer ID search the *CSM_OFFER*
                  table, if you cannot find one have the *EPC* group
                  create one. (/In this example we are looking for a
                  offer ID with the Air and Toll charge of 0.3/)

** Security - Cybersecurity
   We are all responsible for security while implementing new and changing existing apps.
   - Invest consistent with our assessment of the threat landscape
   - Assuring our network, applications and data are secured at all times.
   - Individual and personal responsibility â physical security, desktop locking, to emails sent
   - Logfiles, sensitive information, cpni audits, access and role reviews
   Within the Collaborate tool ensure that there is acknowledgement from the person that is 
   reviewing the code or data change, that all security risks have been addressed.

   To use Collaborate we must learn Collaborate. Luckily there are many free videos on how to do 
   just that.

   When writing software keep in mind any possible bugs that can be exploited such as, SQL injection,
   man in the middle, etc.

   Have your code reviewed by the team and follow the Open Source mantra,
   "Many eyes make all bugs shallow".
** DevSecOps
   - Growing as a team to build the agile framework for our teams.
   - Moving our teams to be agile.
   - Using the agile tools where applicable.

   Ensure that everyone leader has at least one DevOps or Agile goal within their IDPs.
   Ensure that our teams have the needed Agile training and knowledge to support our 
   organization moving toward a more Agile framework.

   Need to learn and master the following Agile tools:
   - Git
   - Jira
   - Collaborate

** Stability

   Maintain high availability of customer and front-line facing systems:
   Continue to deliver accurate and on-time bills
   The total Billing Timeliness and Accuracy metric will be the weighted average of the 
   two components, with timeliness being capped at the midpoint percentage for EE and FE ratings.

   - Timeliness
    - FE = 99.99-100% Delivered on Time
    - EE = 99.97-99.99% Delivered on Time
    - ME = 99.95 - 99.97% Delivered on Time
    - PM = <99.95 % Delivered on Time
   - Accuracy
    - FE = 99.97-100% Accurate Invoices
    - EE = 99.91-99.97% Accurate Invoices
    - ME = 99.69-99.91% Accurate Invoices
    - PM = <99.69% Accurate Invoices

   1. Ensure critical billing issues are handled via Incident bridge to ensure Billing 
   timeliness and Accuracy
   2. Participate in daily Billing calls, monthly meetings with Amdocs and IMC.
   3. Ensure all defects are fully resolved and deployed successfully in production.

   Drive stability through faster issue/incident resolution through Service Ownership (EAGR):
   - Create Playbooks and Operational Support Guides for all team owned services including:
    - Credit Decisioning
    - Fraud Management
    - Billing
    - Payment Processing
    - Usage Processing
    - EOD/EOM and Journaling
    - Credits Processing
    - MCO Processes for Financial Services
    - On-Call
    - Collections Processing

   Rigorous Change Management:
   Reduce the number of changes that are brought to CAB for approval.  
   In 2018 there was 88 changes brought to CAB for approval.  In 2019, this number should 
   be reduced by 10% to 79 changes.

   Help and assist in defect management as well as building monitors to gain insight into a 
   process and to provide better and more useful information. Make sure all code in GITHUB is up to date with the latest changes.
   

** Speed to Market
   Rapid enablement of new products and services using the âfastest time to valueâ approach.

   Continued focus on delivering faster with a concentration on improving quality.

   Implement a DevOps "Shifting Left" Concept - For the development work that the 
   IS Billing and Revenue Dev Ops team are doing (for monitors, controls, altering, 
   reporting, and automation) we should start with building test cases first, then 
   build functionality are that. 

   Rollout the use of the Collaborator tool and the supporting processes.  This tool will be used 
   to automate and facilitate some of the Quality Assurance processes for new or updated code 
   and data changes.

   Ensure that the IS Billing and Revenue Dev Ops team provides all requested audit documentation 
   or surveys to the auditors within the stated deadlines for the following SOX controls:  
   Compliance met for all 4 quarters testing of following controls :
   - CP1001 - Application of Credits vs. Charges
   - CP1003 - Pre-paid Customer Processing Configuration/ Mapping
   - CP2002 - AR Payment Processing Validations
   - CP2003 - Duplicate Payment - Batch Processing
   - CP2004 - Write off of Uncollectable AR
   - CP2007 - AR Payment Processing Error Flagging
   - CP2018 - Duplicate Payment Processing - Real-time Payments

   I will learn and implement Collaborator and Jira and use the Agile processes. Since I've been using agile for quite a while, back when there were known as iterative processes, It should
   be no problem for me to adjust. The only issue I see is that we may take the process to seriously and can handcuff development.

** Savings
   Know the budget for projects.
   Resource investment that adds value.
   Responsible for managing project delivery and operating expenses based on forecasted budgets.
   Responsible for ensuring projects and IRs do not negatively impact operations and increase costs.

   Ensure that operational cost are evaluated for each project that impacts the billing and revenue domains.

   Participate in projects to ensure Operational Excellence including:

   - Trans Union Credit Decisioning (EAGR) 
   - Fraud for Web Evolution (EAGR)
   - VISA and Discover Mandate 
   - Prepaid Evolution 
   - Web Evolution 
   - Replace Nokia/Aeris M2M/CDP 
   - Voice over WiFi 
   - Fixed Wireless 
   - IR430.3 - New First Page of the Bill
   - Paper to Paperless Initiative 
   - Remedy Upgrade 
   - IR0583 â Stand-Alone ESIM Provisioning 
   - PCRF Forklift Project  
   - IR0600 â 5G Commercialization 
   - IR0596 â International Services Revamp 
   - IR0597 â Proxy Identity Access Management 
   - IR0549/CR258 â RCRF for Secondary Device 
   - Verizon VoLTE/LTE Outbound Roaming

   The following projects are mine:
    - Trans Union Credit Decisioning (EAGR) 
    - Voice over WiFi 
    - IR0583 â Stand-Alone ESIM Provisioning 
    - PCRF Forklift Project  
    - IR0600 â 5G Commercialization 
    - IR0596 â International Services Revamp 
    - Verizon VoLTE/LTE Outbound Roaming
  
  I will attend all meetings, ask questions, confer with my Peers and keep my leader updated on the ongoing progress.

  - EGAR
    Become the go to person for both Trans-Union and Fraud. This will be done by studying existing documentation and careful analysis of the logs (including OSB) and reports and help with the playbook if asked. 
  - Learn Python by creating monitors (if appropiate), self study and mentoring.  
  - Create more monitors and add them to the EPS monitors. Some ideas I have is the following:
    - IP usage Check :: Combine both Mr. Smith's and my monitors together to create a graphic that shows the IP prepay usage.
    - Usage Check :: A screen to query an MDN which brings back all information for the customer associated to to that MDN.
    We have a lot of good monitors that are buried in emails and I would like to take some and give them grater visability.
  - Expand knowledge in GITHUB by giving a presentation and cheet sheet on how to use GITHUB for both source control and collaboration.
