Collaboration tools with GitHub

From this point forward whenever we need to add something to GitHub
It is always a good practice to have someone check your work. With USCC going Agile 
The following is a procedure on how to use the GitHubs collaboration tools.
For there original code input it would be best to use the Git command line.

Go to the USCC GITHUB site

List of the collaboration tools in GitHub
How to Checkout

When to clone and when to checkout

Part of Agile is to evolve the processes not to carve anything to be carved in stone but to evolve the process as more information becomes available.
That is why we will start using GitHUb a productive way to change control. One thing I like is the mixture of collaborative tools, the WIKI for instance and code review.

On the left hand corner is where you can find a repositories
go to the repository of choice and when you want to check in 

code... It is here you can go through the source tree and look at the various 
Issues.. You can create issue assign it to whatever

Pull Request.. For code reviews this is where you can look at the reviews, comments, whatever 
- Check in the Code

- Assigners
  An assigner is the person who is in charge of this change
- Appoint reviewers
  A reviewer is someone who will review the code.
- make a comment
