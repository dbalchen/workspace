* Statement of Principals						  
   - /Mathematics is a language with no ambiguity./
   - /A successful man made system will closely resembles some natural system./
   - /A Powerpoint presentation is like smoking a cigar, only the
     person doing it likes it./
   - /Probability from a point./
     -  $a(i) = 1-$ \Large $\frac{i}{n}$ \normalsize where $0 <= i < n$ and $n > 0$

* Usage Overview
   Usage is made up of events which are records of transactions made by our customers. We tend to think of usage
   in two ways, *Voice* and *Data*.\\

*Voice*
   1. *Alcatel Lucent (APLX)* - The *Alcatel Lucent APLX* switch record
      are found mostly in the Maine market. This switch produces both
      /Mobile Originating and Mobile Terminated/ records.
   2. *Nortel (NTI)* - The *NORTEL NTI* switch record is the most common
      voice record format and since an NTI record contains both the
      /originating and terminating features/ certain call types may
      result in a record being generated.
   3. *GSM Roaming* - Voice and data recotrds from our customers who are
      roaming in Europe and other *GSM* countries.
   4. *CIBER* - For /InCollect and OutCollect/ processing.\\

*Data*
   1. *SMSC Server* - Both *Motorola* and *Acatel-Lucent SMS* records
      that can be either a /Mobile Originating or Terminating/ record
      type.
   2. *AAA Server* - Produces one record for each complete data session.
      -  *PGW* - P-Gateway *LTE* data usage
      -  *ECS* - ECS *3G and lower* data usage.
      -  *AAA* - Raw AAA usage found on the CallDump only.
      -  *TAS* - /Volte/ Voice over *LTE*.
   3. *VALI* - /Premium SMS (Valista)/ pre-rated records one record per
      event.
   4. *MMSC* - Used for both pictures and picture messaging text only
      (treated as an *SMS* message in the system). Produces both /Mobile
      Originating and Terminating/ records with a possible one to many
      relationships (multiple recipients).\\
** Pre-Pay and Data Roaming

      In addition to *Post-Pay* we also handle *Pre-Pay* which follows a
      different flow using the diameter interface. The *Diameter
      interface* is described as follows:

      -  *Diameter* is a *AAA* protocol, a type of computer networking
         protocol for authentication, authorization and accounting, and
         is a successor to *RADIUS*. *Diameter* controls communication
         between the authenticator (Secure Ticket Authority, STA) and
         any network entity requesting authentication. *Diameter
         Applications* extend the base protocol by adding new commands
         and/or attributes, such as those for use of the Extensible
         Authentication Protocol (*EAP*).

** Voice Overview

      One major undertaking in the transition to *TOPS*is moving most
      of the voice mediation to the *INTEC*platform. To help facilitate
      this move, the current rules system *(RBMS)*was studied and
      documented. The following provides a brief overview of the
      processes used.
*** Call Types
    1. *M-M* - Mobile to Mobile
    2. *M-L* - Mobile to Land Line
    3. *L-M* - Land Line to Mobile
    4. *L-L* - Land Line to Land Line

The call records can come in four possible states.
    1. Mobile Terminating (Incoming)
    2. Mobile Originating (Outgoing)
    3. *NTI ONLY*
        -  *Both* \\ *(NTI Mobile to Mobile)* in which for every
            voice event, two records are created, a *Mobile
            Originated* and *Mobile Terminated* record. For *APLX*
            this is taken care of automatically. In the case of an
            *NTI* switch, depending on the call scenario, it is up to
             the mediation platform to create one if needed.
        -  *Neither* \\ (per example *L-L* )

*** Incoming - Mobile Terminated
         An *Incoming* call is a /mobile terminated/ call where one of
         our customers receives a call from some caller to a *USCC*
         switch.

         *The diagram below shows the data flow for an incoming
         call:*

#+END_LaTeX
*** Outgoing - Mobile Originated
         An *outgoing* call is a /mobile originating/ call from a *USCC*
         customer in which the following can occur.

* Unified File Format (UFF)
   In *TOPs* system all *CDRs*, excluding *InCollect/OutCollect CIBER*,
   will be reformatted into a /Unified File Format/ (*UFF*). This format
   will be a standard *Unix/ASCII* formatted *CSV* file using '|'
   *(pipe)* as the delimiter.

    -  *Service -* On all *Nortel* switches switch records are
            copied to *mad1rom1*. Then through out the day *Syniverse*
            comes in and finds all the roaming records and runs it
            against there *Fraudx* application to find evidence of
            fraud.
    -  *Thoughts and other random musings* \\ For the most part the
            process is a black box and everything is handled by
            *Syniverse*. The file that is sent is raw switch data and at
            this time only *NTI (Nortel)* is supported. For all NDC
            processes the source, compilation and processing occur on
            the NDC machines where the base language is C.

       -  [ ] What are the names of the NDC machines.
       -  [ ] Where is the source code kept.

       -  *Process Flow*
          1. Switch records are passed through the billing system and
               any record that does not belong to a customer gets placed
               into a file.
          2. Twice a day the /Ciber_Create/ job is run which takes
               these files and converts them to CIBER records.
          3. Five times a day *NDC* starts a job which sends these
               files to *Syniverse*.
          4. It also when it looks for CIBER files coming back from
               *Syniverse* of our customers who are roaming on other
               networks.

       -  *Thoughts and other random musings* \\ A pretty simple batch
            interface it is here where we can use the new batch
            standards to make sure the transfer is complete.

            SID Updates

            SID'S or Switch IDentifiers is a unique 5 digit number that
            correlates to switch. It is with the *SID* that *TOPS*
            defines the all mediation and rating logic and is the first
            enrichment step on a call record.

            -  

               BPT Tables and Process

               When a *SID* is added or changes there is a possibility
               that the following tables need to be changed:

               1. PC9_SID
               2. PC9_SID_LIST
               3. PC9_SERVE_AREA_TO_SID
               4. AGD1_RESOURCES_REF
               5. MI1_STLMNT_CONTRACT
               6. MF1_OUTCOL_SID_PAIR

               New SID Contract Rates

               All *SIDS* changes start with the *SID* table and
               depending on what needs to be done there determines what
               needs to be done to the other 7 tables. For example if it
               is a brand new *SID* all 8 tables need to be updated with
               the most complicated part setting up InCollect and
               OutCollect processing for a *SIDS* contract. The
               following explains in details on what needs to be done:

               1. Find the entry in the *PC9_INCOL_SID_PAIR* where
                  the *SERVE SID* is the contract number and the *HOME
                  SID* = '175' /(USCC contract number)/.

                  1. Expire the date for when you want the new rate to
                     take affect.
                  2. Use the above row as a template for an insert
                     statement.
                  3. *For outcollecs do the same as above except use
                     SERVE SID = '175'*

               2. Create an Insert statement for the
                  *PC9_INCOL_SID_PAIR* with the new rates.
               3. For the OutCollect side find all *SIDS* that that have
                  the *Settlement Contract Code*, /(In this example we
                  trying to find all *SIDS* with settlement contract
                  code = 287)/

               #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
                   SELECT SIDS FROM PC9_SID WHERE SETLMNT_CONTRACT_CD = '287';
               #+END_EXAMPLE

               1. For each *SID* found add '175' to the end and use that
                  as the resource value for the table
                  *AGD1_RESOURCES_REF* then create an insert if it
                  don't exists.

               | *Column*                    | *Value*                             |
               |-----------------------------+-------------------------------------|
               | *RESOURCE_SEGMENT*         | *ResourceSegmentCalc_Sh*           |
               | *RESOURCE_VALUE*           | SID + '175'                         |
               | *RESOURCE_TYPE*            | 21 (for OutCollect)                 |
               | *SUBSCRIBER_ID*            | sequential number /(1, 2, 3,...)/   |
               | *SUB_STATUS*               | A (default)                         |
               | *ROUTING_POLICY_ID*       | 0 (for Postpaid)                    |
               | *PAYMENT_CATEGORY*         | POST (default)                      |
               | *CUSTOMER_ID*              | 1 + SID                             |
               | *BILL_CYCLE*               | 99                                  |
               | *LARGE_CUST_IND*          | ‘N'                                 |
               | *RESOURCE_HASH_VALUE*     | *ResourceSegmentCalc_Sh*           |
               | *SUBSCRIBER_HASH_VALUE*   | *SubsriberHashValueCalc_Sh*        |

               1. For each *SID* found add a '1' in front which will get
                  you the *customer_id* then do a query against the
                  *APE1_SUBSCR_DATA_REF* to get the subscriber_id
                  /(Using the above as an example)/

               | *Column*                    | *Value*                             |
               |-----------------------------+-------------------------------------|
               | *CYCLE_CODE*               | 99                                  |
               | *CUSTOMER_SEGMENT*         | *CustomerSegmentCalc_Sh*           |
               | *SUBSCRIBER_ID*            | Sequential number /(1, 2, 3,...)/   |
               | *CUSTOMER_ID*              | 1 + SID                             |
               | *SUBSCRIBER_HASH_VALUE*   | *SubscriberHashCalculator*          |

               1. Once you have the subscriber you need to point each
                  entries offer ID's from the
                  *APE1_SUBSCR_OFFERS_REF* table to the correct air
                  and toll charge. /(Again using the above example)/ To
                  find a suitable offer ID search the *CSM_OFFER*
                  table, if you cannot find one have the *EPC* group
                  create one. (/In this example we are looking for a
                  offer ID with the Air and Toll charge of 0.3/)

               #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
                   SELECT * FROM CSM_OFFER WHERE SOC_NAME LIKE '%_0.03_Air_0.03_Toll_PP%';
               #+END_EXAMPLE

               | *Column*                  | *Value*                             |
               |---------------------------+-------------------------------------|
               | *CYCLE_CODE*             | 99                                  |
               | *CUSTOMER_SEGMENT*       | *CustomerSegmentCalc_Sh            |
               | *SUBSCRIBER_ID*          | sequential number /(1, 2, 3,...)/   |
               | *OFFER_ID*               | SOC_ID                             |
               | *OFFER_INSTANCE*         | Subscriber ID                       |
               | SUBSCRIBER_HASH_VALUE   | *SubsriberHashValueCalc_Sh*        |

               Hash Creation Programs

               Some tables require that a unique hash value be created
               to create those values use these programs:

               #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
                   ~/abp_home/core/bin/SubsriberHashValueCalc_Sh  <SUBSCRIBER_ID>

                   ~/abp_home/core/bin/ResourceSegmentCalc_Sh     <Resource Type> 21 = (OutCollects)
                                                                  <Resource Value> 
                                                                  <Resource value length>

                   ~/abp_home/core/bin/CustomerSegmentCalc_Sh     <CUSTOMER_ID>
               #+END_EXAMPLE

               #+BEGIN_HTML
                 <div class="figure">
               #+END_HTML

               [[Pictures/Meissner_War_Bulletins.jpg]]

               #+BEGIN_HTML
                 </div>
