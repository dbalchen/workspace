* Statement of Principals						  
   - /Mathematics is a language with no ambiguity./
   - /A successful man made system will closely resembles some natural system./
   - /A PowerPoint presentation is like smoking a cigar, only the
     person doing it likes it./
   - /Probability from a point./
     -  $a(i) = 1-$ \Large $\frac{i}{n}$ \normalsize where $0 <= i < n$ and $n > 0$
* TOPS Operations
** Acquisition and Formating (A&F)
   *A&F* is the first stage of the mediation process where the *UFF* or *CIBER* record is examined, enriched 
   and transfered to an intermediatary /usage/ format. For *CIBER* records an extra rules step is 
   added to further mediate the records.

** TurboCharging
   The most important /sub-system/ in *TOPS*. It is here that all usage is mediated and rated.\\

      -  *Event flow:*
         1. An event comes in to via a network element
         2. Transforms data into a conical form which also includes the
            network element.
         3. Gets Rated
            -  For *Pre-Pay* the HLR. is handled by the
               *SCP*
      -  *International Calls* Using rates from the *LD_COUNTRY_RATES* table international calls are rated by country.
      -  We convert everything to the *Home SID time* for bill
         presentment.
      -  Limiting or /choking/ usage can be handled by *Diameter* for
         real-time and *Turbo-Charging* for *Post-Pay*
*** Event Servers
    *Turbo-Charging* is not one application but multiple instances of *Event Servers*. Each event server corresponds to a bill cycle. Their status can be viewed using
         the following query on the *PRDAF* database.

         : SELECT * FROM ADJ3_JOBS_INST_CTRL WHERE JOB_NAME = 'ADJ1EVENTSRV';

         From the output if the column *event status = Y* then that
         particular server is in use. If your job requires an event
         server that is already in use you can change it to one that is
         not by using *SQL* below on the *PRDCUST* database logged in as
         *PRDOPRC*.

         In this example we are setting the job rec to run using the
         *ES_EOC1045* event server

          :   Update OP_APP_DATA set data = 'ES_EOC1045'
          :          where JOB_REC = '{Your Job Rec}' and field_seq_num = 1 
          :          and table_NAME IN ('ADJ1EVENTSRV');

*** Rerate Servers
         In addition we have three *Rerate Servers* they are:
         1. *RRP_EOC1056*
         2. *RRP_EOC1068*
         3. *RRP_EOC1192*

** AEM
         *AEM* gets the Turbo-Charging errors from the
         *APE1_REJECTED_EVENTS* table. For *A&F* they are in the
         *EM1_RECORD* table. Since there are so many coulmns in the
         *EM1_RECORD* table we must limit are query's to the following
         columns. [[file:docs/EM1%20Query's][EM1 Queries]]

** Overage Protection
      Overage notifications are detected on an event by event basis. As
      events are processed by *TC* and added to the *APE1_ACCUMULATORS*
      table a check is made against the
      *L9_FIRST_THRESHOLD/L9_SECOND_THRESHOLD* fields. If an overage
      is detected the ***FIELD*** CTN is added to file (segregated by
      unique *TC* file?) in the NTF directory. MFT then pulls these
      files and delivers to DMI for distribution. A note is added to the
      NOTIFICATION_HUB.SMS_NOTIFICATION table (ODS) indicating the
      message was sent by DMI.

** Billing Process
      The billing process follows a map which is created by the job
      *ADJ3_APR_CycleBillRun_Sh*. If it completes successfully it
      will create a billing map that will look something like the
      following:

** Log File Location
   -  Alias
      -  *cdlog* - cd to the logfile directory.
      -  *cdswitch (Batch2 Only)* - cd to the switch directory.
      -  *aprout* - cd to the *CIBER* out directories.

* Usage Overview
   Usage is made up of events which are records of transactions made by our customers. We tend to think of usage
   in two ways, *Voice* and *Data*.\\

*Voice*
   1. *Alcatel Lucent (APLX)* - The *Alcatel Lucent APLX* switch record
      are found mostly in the Maine market. This switch produces both
      /Mobile Originating and Mobile Terminated/ records.
   2. *Nortel (NTI)* - The *NORTEL NTI* switch record is the most common
      voice record format and since an NTI record contains both the
      /originating and terminating features/ certain call types may
      result in a record being generated.
   3. *CIBER* - For /InCollect and OutCollect/ processing.\\

*Data*
   1. *SMSC Server* - Both *Motorola* and *Acatel-Lucent SMS* records
      that can be either a /Mobile Originating or Terminating/ record
      type.
   2. *AAA Server* - Produces one record for each complete data session.
      - *PGW* - P-Gateway *LTE* data usage
      - *ECS* - ECS *3G and lower* data usage.
      - *AAA* - Raw AAA usage found on the CallDump only.
      - *TAS* - /Volte/ Voice over *LTE*.
   3. *VALI* - /Premium SMS (Valista)/ pre-rated records one record per
      event.
   4. *GSM Roaming* - Voice and data records from our customers who are
      roaming in Europe and other *GSM* countries.
   5. *MMSC* - Used for both pictures and picture messaging text only
      (treated as an *SMS* message in the system). Produces both /Mobile
      Originating and Terminating/ records with a possible one to many
      relationships (multiple recipients).\\

** Pre-Pay and Data Roaming

      In addition to *Post-Pay* we also handle *Pre-Pay* which follows a
      different flow using the diameter interface. The *Diameter
      interface* is described as follows:

      -  *Diameter* is a *AAA* protocol, a type of computer networking
         protocol for authentication, authorization and accounting, and
         is a successor to *RADIUS*. *Diameter* controls communication
         between the authenticator (Secure Ticket Authority, STA) and
         any network entity requesting authentication. *Diameter
         Applications* extend the base protocol by adding new commands
         and/or attributes, such as those for use of the Extensible
         Authentication Protocol (*EAP*).

** Voice Overview
   One major undertaking in the transition to *TOPS* is moving most of the voice mediation to the *INTEC* platform. To help facilitate this move, the current rules system *(RBMS)* was studied and documented. The following provides a brief overview of the processes used.
*** Call Types
    1. *M-M* - Mobile to Mobile
    2. *M-L* - Mobile to Land Line
    3. *L-M* - Land Line to Mobile
    4. *L-L* - Land Line to Land Line
    The call records can come in four possible states.
    1. Mobile Terminating (Incoming)
    2. Mobile Originating (Outgoing)
    3. *NTI ONLY*
       - *Both*  \newline *(NTI Mobile to Mobile)* in which for every voice event, two records are created, a *Mobile Originated* and *Mobile Terminated* record. For *APLX* this is taken care of automatically. In the case of an *NTI* switch, depending on the call scenario, it is up to the mediation platform to create one if needed.
       - *Neither* \newline (per example *L-L* )

\begin{landscape}  
#+END_LaTeX
*** Incoming - Mobile Terminated
         An *Incoming* call is a /mobile terminated/ call where one of
         our customers receives a call from some caller to a *USCC*
         switch.\\
         *The diagram below shows the data flow for an incoming
         call:* \\

\newpage 
#+END_LaTeX
*** Outgoing - Mobile Originated
    An *outgoing* call is a /mobile originating/ call from a *USCC* customer in which the following can occur.\\

* Unified File Format (UFF)
   In *TOPs* system all *CDRs*, excluding *InCollect/OutCollect CIBER*,
   will be reformatted into a /Unified File Format/ (*UFF*). This format
   will be a standard *Unix/ASCII* formatted *CSV* file using '|'
   *(pipe)* as the delimiter.

** CIBERNET - Specification/Reference
   https://www.one1clear.net/mxp/Login.asp
* Consolidated Billing
  *MABEL* is an industry standard electronic method for a customer to receive their invoices.  
  The *MABEL* process will allow a customer with multiple accounts to have those accounts consolidated into one file following the *MABEL* standards. 
  
  *Consolidated Billing* is comprised of three billing formats, a customer can get one, many or all of these formats:
  1. Invoice Reports (produced and emailed by the DMI and Cognos teams based on XML files from TOPS)
  2. Mabel (consolidated by us based on individual Mabel files that are produced by TOPS and sent by the MFT team using sftp)
  3. MobilSense (a 3rd party web interface, which loads data based on consolidated Mabel files and sent by the MFT team using sftp)

  The *EBI* server contains 
  *Super Secret MABEL Password* sudo /bin/su - p_mabel1
** Mabel File Format
   A mabel file can  come in two flavors (standards) 2 or 3. 
   - [[file:docs/MABEL%20Hierarchy.pdf][MABEL File Heirarchy]] 
   - [[file:docs/Mable2_record_structure_C07.pdf][MABEL 2.0 Record Structure]]
   - [[file:docs/Mabel3_record_structure_CH07.pdf][MABEL 3.0 Record Structure]]
** Mable Jobs

   can be found in this perl script on the 
   EBI server: */apps/ebi/mabel1/checks/jacob/allCNSLDTDRPT.pl*

*** How to Manually Validate MABEL files
    - Query Brmprd
    :   select file_path||file_name from mabel_control
    :    where file_type = 'act'
    :        and cycle_run_year = 2018
    :        and cycle_run_month = 10
    :        and consolidator = 90093 
    :        and application_id = 'load  '
    :    order by cycle_code 
    - Create A File Containing Full File Path And Names In The Following Directory
      : o_mabel1@kpr01oprmn:mabel1/valSingle> pwd
      : /apps/ebi/mabel1/valSingle
      :  FOR EXAMPLE
      :   ll 90093_oct_files
      :    -rw-rw-r-- 1 o_mabel1 ebiprd 12376 Oct 25 14:37 90093_oct_files
    - Run Each File Through The Sfv (Single File Validator)

** Payment File
         Once in a while payment files break due to either bad sequence
         numbers or format issues. For the most part you should tell
         Amdocs to put the file in CN status and have *Payment Control*
         to resend. If the file is also out of sequence have payment
         control send it with a new sequence number. If the whole file
         fails, not just records, then have Payment Control send a new
         file with a new sequence number.

*** VISITOR_MIN_LR
         This table is created via a program and contains all of our
         roaming partners MIN/SID block ranges. It is located on the
         *BRMPRD* database.

*** MI1_STLMNT_CONTRACT
         The Settlement Contracts table contains one record for each
         contract. A contract is defined as the entity to which a group
         of *SIDS* belongs, whose common attribute is the
         clearinghouse-related Net Settlement bank account. This usually
         means that all the *SIDS* that belong to a settlement contract
         are part of one operating company.

*** MF1_OUTCOL_DESTINATION
         This table includes detailed information on every destination.
         A destination represents a target of Out-collect calls (such as
         a clearinghouse). The destination of every roamer call is
         determined according to the Home *SID* value of that call.

*** MF1_OUTCOL_SID_PAIR
         Defines out-collect roaming agreement between *SID* pair.
         Originating category is retrieve from the table that is used
         later on for service filter determination. *INCOL_SID_PAIR*
         and *SID* tables are also used by Acquisition & Formatting.
